Once, it used to be the heart of the powerful Austro-Hungarian Empire. Here, the culture and traditions of the nations which were the part of the Empire, are inextricably intertwined. The convenient location at the intersection of the biggest trade routes turned Austria into a territory where fights and battles had not been stopping for many centuries. However, everything changed after World War I: the Empire decayed, and as a result, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. The year of 1955 when the law of permanent neutrality was signed became the crucial one for the destiny of the country. Since then, the country does not participate in wars and is a genuine model of stability, reliability, and safety not only in Europe but in the whole world in general."

Nearby there is a statue of the famous Mother Teresa. Around the square, there are buildings in different architectural styles. We recommend you visiting Efem Bey Mosque, the Orthodox Resurrection Cathedral, the clock tower, the Historical and Archaeological Museum.

You can also look at the Congress building, walk through the Grand Park of Tirana, and the city streets, admire the famous colorful houses of the locals. By the way, in the south of the city, there is a large artificial lake, near which you can have a picnic or sit in a cafe. The key attraction is the national park on Mount Dajti (Dajtit).

The best place to admire the scenery is from the main attraction \u2014 Rozafa Castle. Walk through stone ruins and look out from its observation towers. From here, you can see the picturesque scenery, the city itself, and the famous lead mosque on the palm of your hand. The entrance is paid, and there is also a Museum of the Castle, which you can visit for an extra fee. Lake Skadar or Lake Shkod\u00ebr is the second renowned attraction. It is the largest fresh lake on the Balkan Peninsula. Make sure you check out the views from the coast, walk in the forests and take a boat tour of its water surface! Shkod\u00ebr is distinguished by the fact that it is a Catholic city (the majority of the population is Muslim); at the same time, many other religious buildings are belonging to different confessions.</p><h3>Vlor\u00eb</h3><p>The first capital of independent Albania also deserves your attention. We are talking about the large port city of Vlor\u00eb. It is located in the southwest, 147 kilometers from Tirana. Its main attractions are the Muradiye Mosque, the Historical and Ethnographic Museum, and the Museum of Independence. Lovers of antiquities should visit the Porto Palermo Castle and the ancient amphitheater Orikum (I century B.C.).

It is also called the \"Southern Gate\" of Albania. Sandy beaches and favorable climate (about 300 sunny days per year) attract resort recreation lovers. And those wishing to explore the antiquities can visit the Butrint National Park, not far from Saranda (has the UNESCO World Heritage status), look at the ruins of the ancient city of Phoenike, with a huge Acropolis and Jewish synagogues. Be sure to take a picture at Blue Eye, a natural spring, 16 kilometers northeast of Sarand\u00eb.</p><h3>Gjirokast\u00ebr</h3><p>The famous Albanian museum city of Gjirokast\u00ebr, located in the south of the country, is on the road between Tirana and Sarand\u00eb in the Drin Valley. The town is known as an example of perfectly preserved medieval architecture of the Ottoman Empire. In 2005, it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list. The city itself is small, with narrow streets, so it is better to explore it on foot. The main sights are the fortress of the XII century and the Museum of Arms. The city has a lot of cafes and souvenir shops. We recommend you buying something as a souvenir, and also have a look at the bazaar in the Old Town. By the way, vegetables and fruits in Albania are quite cheap.</p>"

The city is small and, in fact, is a big shopping center. So, go shopping. The city's malls and boutiques offer a wide range of international brands, which can be purchased here at a much lower price. In the capital, it is also worth seeing the church called Esgl\u00e9sia de Sant Esteve (XI-XII century), visit the medieval fortress Casa de la Vall with its chapel, and the museum of philatelists.\n        In the evening, you can relax in a cozy cafe or restaurant. One of the famous architectural sights of Andorra that you should definitely see is the Pont de la Margineda of the XII century. It has a great view, and engineers are still wondering about the mystery of its amazing stability.

Their water is used both for medicinal purposes and in various water attractions. Be sure to visit the Perfume Museum and learn everything about the world of scents.

Because Minsk is really able to surprise: Stalin's Empire of the City of the Sun and the Cathedral of Saint Virgin Mary in the Wile\u0144ski Baroque style, neo-Gothic lines of the Church of Saints Simon and Helena, and classical plays, creative art hubs and old quarters, impressive new buildings and, like a cherry on a cake, a huge glass rhombicuboctahedron of the National Library of Belarus.\n        You will feel the unique atmosphere of the city as soon as you take a couple of steps through the Gates of Minsk, and you won't even notice how the charm of the capital captures you.\n\n<h3>Gomel</h3><p>Minsk is beautiful, but like any other capital city, it is fast, thundering, and fussy. How much better is Gomel, the town above the Sozh! Unhurried walks through the green squares, the old Sovetskaya Street, sometimes taking you to secret courtyards with authentic establishments, colorful sunsets, which lovers see off from the middle of the longest pedestrian bridge in the country \u2014 this is about Gomel. Make sure you visit the main attraction of the city \u2014 the Rumyantsev-Paskevich Residence, known for its chic architectural and park complex.&nbsp;</p><h3>Brest</h3><p>Behind Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, on the very border of Belarus and Poland, there is Brest, a city with a rich history. The walls of the famous Brest Fortress have become the venue of many important historical events. Today, you can hear the bells of cathedrals, the songs of street musicians, the noise from the open areas of trendy bars, and the hum of passers-by, who wander aimlessly through the ancient cobbled streets behind the high fortification. Brest is charming in detail, even as a cute torchbearer lights city lights on Sovetsky Avenue every evening. It is a perfect place for a quiet, measured weekend.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mogilev</h3><p>Mogilev, a modest city with metropolitan ambitions, is situated on the wide rapids of the Dnieper. Here, every street remembers the epochs of the greats \u2014 Alexander Pushkin was watering passers-by with champagne from the windows of the College of Culture at the present Komsomolskaya Street; Feodor Chaliapin was performing opera on the stage of the Drama Theatre; the great Vera Komissarzhevskaya was resting in the park after the performances; and who knows, maybe Nicholas II once sat on that very bench? Mogilev is charming, but you won't have time to get bored: take a ride on catamarans along the Dubrovenka or on a bicycle through the thick pine groves of the Pechersk Lake Park, walk along the ancient streets, and make sure you go to the festival of soap bubbles and potato pancakes.</p><h3>Grodno</h3><p>Grodno is the cultural capital of Belarus, the second capital of the Belarusian People's Republic, and the third capital of Rzeczpospolita. This city is a completely different Belarus, where Poles and Lithuanians feel like home, while locals are more often in Europe than in Minsk. Cobblestone paved Sovetskaya Street, Museum of Iron, eclectic interiors of the Old and New Castles, St. Francis Xavier Cathedral, Lutheran Church, Castle Hill \u2014 there's plenty to see in Grodno. And we have not yet listed theatres, private and public museums, and creative spaces, where the cultural elite of the city organize meetings.&nbsp;</p><h3>Vitebsk</h3><p>But if you don't have enough culture in Grodno, go to Vitebsk, the small capital of the Renaissance. Chagall and Zadkine were born here, Malevich gave lectures, and Repin sipped tea from a plate on the summer veranda of the estate. People come here for a quiet bohemian rest, leisurely stroll along its well-groomed streets, and admire the picturesque views of the Western Dvina and Vi\u0107ba rivers. We recommend visiting the Holy Assumption Cathedral, Vitebsk Town Hall, the Marc Chagall Museum, walk along the pedestrian Suvorov Street and, of course, buy a ticket to the famous festival of culture Slavic Bazaar, which is held every year in July.</p>"

Burying them in the ground is prohibited, as they can lie in the ground without decomposing for several years in a harsh climate. Breaking the ban is punishable by very high fines.</li><li>Fishing is one of the attractions for tourists, but a fishing license must be obtained in advance from the tourist office.</li><li>The land of eternal ice is quite expensive for living.

The names of the ancient philosophers Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, and such masters of drama as Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Euripides, are closely associated with the name of this city. One or two days will not be enough to visit all the sights of Athens. There are over two hundred museums alone.\n        In addition to them, a tourist has to find time to see a large number of ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the temples of Zeus and Hephaestus, the Tower of the Winds, and Panathinaikos Stadium, which hosted the first Olympic Games in modern history. The best panoramic view of Athens can be seen from Philopappos and Lykavitos Hills. The first one offers a magnificent view of the Acropolis and the architectural ensemble consisting of the Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, Parthenon and Erechtheion. And when the weather is good, you can see the Saronic Gulf, the Port of Piraeus, and even the nearby island of Aegina from Lykavitos.\n\n<h3>Thessaloniki</h3><p>Thessaloniki is Greece's second-largest city, its northern capital, and the cultural center. Many of the monuments of Thessaloniki are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Tourists who come to this ancient city have places to explore. Its architecture has not been exposed to modern changes. There are no skyscrapers, and all the buildings are not too high. The White Tower of Thessaloniki is a so-called symbol and the main attraction of the city. Visitors can see the exposition of the Museum of Byzantine Culture and climb to the observation deck, which offers stunning views of the city and the central waterfront. Archaeological lovers will be interested in visiting the ancient city of Dion (dedicated to the god Zeus), which is 90 km from Thessaloniki.</p><h3>Halkidiki</h3><p>The peninsula of Halkidiki is located in north-eastern Greece, on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. It is a real paradise for tourists. Halkidiki consists of three separate peninsulas: Kassandra, Sithonia, and Athos. Kassandra is considered to be the most popular part of the resort, where the most comfortable hotels and beaches are located. Sithonia is associated with measured relaxation with small cozy coves and well-maintained beaches. Athos is a convent republic that consists of 20 orthodox monasteries. An interesting fact is that since ancient times there has been a ban on visiting the Holy Mountain by any female creatures. It concerns not only women but also animals. For violation of the law, criminal liability with a term of imprisonment from 8 to 12 months is provided. Men must obtain a special permit (diamonitirion) to visit Athos. Athos offers fascinating sightseeing tours in the monasteries of Meteora.</p><h3>Crete</h3><p>Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth-largest in the Mediterranean Sea. Several seas wash it at once - Libyan, Cretan, Ionian Seas. In the lagoon of Balos, you can watch all three seas merge. It is stunningly beautiful, with the water shimmering in all shades of blue. Heraklion is considered to be the capital of Crete, while other major cities include Rethymno, Lasithi, and Chania. There are many historical attractions here, but the Palace of Knossos, the Arkadi Monastery, and the old Venetian port of Chania deserve special attention.</p><h3>Corfu</h3><p>Corfu (K\u00e9rkyra) is the second-largest island in the Ionian Islands. It is covered with cypress forests, olive groves, and orange plantations. It is, without exaggeration, a green paradise. The old town is surrounded by fortress walls built to protect it during the Venetian protectorate. It is a perfect island for a beach vacation. You should keep in mind that the water is warmer in the east of the country, so take this fact into account while choosing resorts. On the island, you should visit the resort village of Paleokastritsa with its caves and monastery, the Achilleion Palace and Saint Spiridon Orthodox Cathedral, dating back to the XV century.</p><h3>Rhodes</h3><p>Rhodes is another beautiful Greek resort island. It is located in the Aegean Sea near Turkey. The coastline of Rhodes is an endless chain of sandy beaches. The capital of the island is the town of Rhodes, built by the Knights Hospitaller. Fortifications of Rhodes are the main attraction of the city, built during the blossom of the Byzantine Empire. The historical part of the town is a significant cultural heritage of world importance.</p><h3>Kos</h3><p>The island of Kos, located 4 km from the southwest coast of Turkey, will also be a great place to relax. According to one version, the name \"Kos\" is derived from the word \"crab\". In ancient times, the crab was the emblem of the island and minted on local coins. The father of world medicine, Hippocrates, was born on Kos. Lovers of antiquity are attracted here by the ruins of 22 early Christian basilicas, the most famous of which is the Basilica of Saint Stephen in Kefalos. It will also be interesting to visit the castles of Knights Hospitaller of the XV-XVI centuries in Andimachia and Kefalos, as well as the Byzantine castle in Pelion.</p>"

            "en": "The Republic of Ireland is a state that occupies the largest part of the territory of the homonymous island. It also includes 35 small inhabited islands and about 20 that are not populated nowadays. The Atlantic Ocean washes the coast of Ireland in the north and west, the Irish Sea, the Straits of St. George and the Northern Sea in the east, and the Celtic Sea in the south. The length of the border with Great Britain is 360 kilometers. Here, the climate is mild, and plants do not lose green outfits all year round, that's why the island is called Emerald. The landscape is mainly flat, but there are low mountains and plateaus on the island's outskirts. The territory of Ireland is divided into four provinces, which include 26 traditional counties."

            "en": "\n  Dublin is the capital and main port of the country. Here, you won't find any mind-blowing skyscrapers, world financial exchanges, and three-level road junctions on where the life of all modern capitals rushes. On the contrary, life in Dublin is measured and calm. Only a couple of times a year does the city explode during the bustling celebrations of St. Patrick and Bloom Days. Dublin is a city with a rich history that you can touch with your own hands. It is within the walls of the majestic St.\n        Patrick's Cathedral, where Jonathan Swift created his Gulliver; in the library of the prestigious Trinity College, which houses the ancient manuscript known as the Book of Kells; in the Bell Tower of St. John's Church; in museums that tremblingly preserve the works of Velazquez, Picasso and Vermeer. But still, the Guinness Beer Museum (official name \u2014 \"St. James's Gate Brewery\") is the most visited attraction in Dublin (over 700,000 visitors a year). After getting acquainted with its most exciting exposition, you can go up to the observation deck of the museum, where you will be offered to taste the brewed beer and admire the panoramic view of the city.&nbsp;\n\n<p>Galway is a port town that has grown from Fort D\u00fan Bhun na Gaillimh on the west coast of the country. It has a festival temper with annual events dedicated to theatre, poetry, and ancient music. But the Oyster Festival and Galway Racing are especially famous. If this is your first time in town, start at Eyre Square; stroll through the scenic park of the National University of Ireland; look through the windows of Lynch's Castle, the one that invented the concept of lynching; take a photo at the Cathedral and St. Nicholas Collegiate Church and make sure you make a one-day trip to the Cliffs of Moher. The shadow turns the high cliffs almost black, the sun highlights the green hats of the meadows, and the white foam of the ocean blinds your eyes \u2014 it's truly an unforgettable experience!&nbsp;</p><p>In the heart of South Munster's most picturesque province, on the green hills of the rocky Atlantic coast, Limerick has grown to become a university city with a unique medieval charm. It is known for its colorful Gregorian architecture, massive fortifications, and an active nightlife. Local clubs and bars regularly host parties, stand-up comedies, and poetry evenings. The other places worth visiting include King John's Castle, on the banks of the River Shannon, the St. John's Cathedral, and the Hunt Museum, which displays a sketch by Picasso, an engraving by Paul Gauguin and a horse figure created by Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p>Cork is one of the largest cities in Ireland, located on the southwest coast. It is strict and pedantic during the day, while at night, it is bustling and noisy. Free and wild people would be interested in visiting numerous bars on St. Patrick's Street, and tourists with children would love Fota Wildlife Park. There are few prominent historical buildings in the city, which include the spectacular Neo-Gothic St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. The neighborhood offers plenty of attractions for more than a weekend. First of all, we recommend visiting the ancient Blarney Castle. There are legends that if you kiss the Blarney Stone on one of the walls of the fort, you will be given an oratorical talent in the blink of an eye. It is unknown if it is true or not, but the stone has already earned fame as \"the most unhygienic sight in Europe\".</p><p>The city of Killarney in County Kerry began to earn money from tourism back in the XVIII century when the rest of Ireland was not even aware of this possibility. The infrastructure of the city is as comfortable as possible for tourists. There are plenty of attractions to see: the Neo-Gothic Cathedral of St. Mary, a Flemish altar in Muckross Abbey, hiking trails in the National Park, Torc Waterfall, and Ross Castle. Try the delicious seafood in the local restaurants and visit the music pubs, which are famous for their best folk songs performed all over the country. Then take a miniature journey along the Ring of Kerry, a scenic route along the coastline of the Iveragh Peninsula with some of the best views of the Atlantic coast.&nbsp;</p><p>In the middle of the XX century, the Red Vikings founded Waterford in southern Ireland. The fortress walls of the old town center, Reginald's Tower, Treasure Museum \u2014 every corner of the city keeps mysteries and legends about the harsh people who used to inhabit it. After a stroll through Waterford's paved streets and shady park alleys, be sure to check out T&amp;H Doolan's pub, which has been serving excellent beer and whiskey for over 300 years. But don't get carried away with alcohol as Waterford's neighborhood is also full of fantastic places. Be sure to visit the Sion Hill House &amp; Gardens, the authentic fishing village of Dunmore East, and the Blue Flag awarded beaches of Ardmore.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Reykjavik</h3>\n\nReykjavik is Iceland's capital and its largest city, home to the majority of the country's population. When exploring the streets of the world's northernmost capital, make sure you visit a Lutheran church with the complicated name Hallgr\u00edmskirkja, the cathedral, and Whale Museum. You'll find another unique temple with unusual architecture, Landakotskirkja, or Cathedral of Christ the King on the hilltop of the city. Perlan is another fascinating attraction.\n        This is the boiler house, and its tanks are filled continuously with thermal water to heat the buildings of the town. At the same time, it is an observation deck for those who want to admire the city from a height through special panoramic telescopes. There is also a so-called restaurant here, the floor of which is constantly rotating, and the Saga Museum, consisting of wax figures that tell about the life and traditions of the locals. From Reykjavik, you can make a day trip to the Golden Ring: watch the Gullfoss Falls break down in the gorge, walk along the geothermal Haukadalur valley, take a photo of the Keri\u00f0 crater, visit the \u00deingvellir National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and at the end - to warm up in the hot torrent of the Hverager\u00f0i river. The Icelandic Phallological Museum is another \"highlight\" of Reykjavik. It features over 200 species of animal phalli. The open-air water park with geothermally heated pools is especially popular among the public and tourists.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Keflavik</h3><p>Keflavik is a small town where any tourist will inevitably visit. It is the main airport in the country, so your acquaintance with Iceland will start with Keflavik. The most famous attraction of this seaside town is the Blue Lagoon - a geothermal resort, which is distinguished by its delicate blue water color. In summer, whale and dolphin watching are organized for tourists. Sea cruises remain to be the most popular option for family holidays.&nbsp;</p><h3>Torn of continents</h3><p>If you drive counter-clockwise along Ring Road #1 from Reykjavik, at some point, you'll have to jump from North American to Eurasian Lithosphere Plate. This \"torn of continents\" is located in the south of Iceland, in the picturesque Thingvellir National Park, the first meeting place of the Icelandic Parliament, the oldest one in the world. Behind the basalt rocks of Thing's fields, you will find the capital of the southern region, the city of Selfoss. The town itself is not very remarkable. The Ghost Centre Museum, the Tree and Art Gallery, and the Art Gallery are popular among tourists. But don't worry, you won't be bored for a long time: local travel agencies offer a lot of options for active leisure. Some exciting and extraordinary activities include horse riding in the city outskirts near raging waterfalls and lakes overlooking glaciers; extreme rafting on the \u00d6lfus\u00e1 River, where you can't tell whether there is more water or salmon; trips to the most famous crater lake in Iceland \u2014 Keri\u00f0.</p><h3>Austurland region</h3><p>The Austurland region takes the traveler into its ice shackles. The largest glacier on the island, Vatnaj\u00f6kull, hides a volcano and ice caves under its cold thickness. Its waters feed the largest ice lagoon in Iceland, J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n, which azure blows your mind. Nearby, in Skaftafell National Park, the Svartifoss waterfall is buzzing. Framed in hexagonal basalt columns, it is one of the park's most popular attractions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Egilsstadir</h3><p>The city of Egilsstadir, the capital of Austurland, is situated 300 kilometers from the park. Its colorful houses stand near Lake Lagarflj\u00f3t. Thanks to the largest forest area in Iceland, the city has a beautiful ecological environment. We recommend going to see the beauty of Hengifoss, Iceland's third-highest waterfall, and move on!</p><h3>Akureyri</h3><p>Akureyri hides in the depths of Ayia Fjord. It is the second most important city in the country. The northern capital is protected from the cold winds of the Arctic by high mountains. Here you shall find the largest ski resort in Iceland \u2014 Hl\u00ed\u00f0arfjall. It offers perfect conditions for hockey players and figure skaters, and fans of underwater fishing will find perfect holes in rivers and lakes. The main sights of Akureyri are outside the city limits. These are Godafoss Falls, Sulfur volcano and volcanic Lake Askja. If you have some time, you should visit the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss, which is often compared in its magnificence with Niagara.</p><h3>Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur</h3><p>Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur lays on the picturesque banks of the Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. It is the main city of the Nordurland-Vestra region. It is known as the center of Icelandic horse breeding. Every local citizen has several horses, and once a year, the city gathers the whole country for the horse festival. There is a thermal pool in 15 kilometers from Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur, where you can warm yourself up surrounded by snow-covered mountain slopes. Glaumb\u00e6r Farm &amp; Museum is a must-visit spot on the map. Its mossy turf houses are fabulous! Also, stop by Reykjafoss Falls and check out the Atlantic Ocean and the weird basalt cliffs on the banks of the Vatnsnes Peninsula.&nbsp;</p><h3>\u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur</h3><p>North-West Iceland is ready to shelter you in the city of \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, the capital of the Western Fjords. It stands on the banks of the picturesque Skutuls Fjord, surrounded by absolutely wild nature. Usually, tourists arrive in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur on liners, cruising the Icelandic fjords. The ancient streets of the city are designed for a leisurely walk to get acquainted with the town \u2014 one day is pretty much enough. From \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, you can go to the island of Vigur, where the smallest post office and the only windmill in Iceland are located. Go for a walk through the most beautiful green valleys, visit the Dynjandi waterfall, and also get to the \"bird market\" at Cape Latrabjarg.</p><h3>Borgarnes</h3><p>Borgarnes is the homeland of Icelandic heroes Erik the Red and Leif Erikson, and the administrative center of Westerland. The city specializes in organizing eco-tours: hiking along the trails of the Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull National Park at the foot of the glacier of the same name; descent to the oldest and longest lava caves in Iceland \u2014 Surtshellir and V\u00ed\u00f0gelmir, with their colored stalactites and stalagmites; trips to black volcanic beaches, with surreal lava formations along the coast; tours to hot springs and waterfalls; cruises in the Borgarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur Fjord. The Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula is located within an easy reach from here. It is often called \"Iceland in miniature\" due to its diverse landscapes. In winter, Sn\u00e6fellsnes is perfect for taking pictures of northern lights, so don't forget to charge your camera's battery.</p>"

Nowadays, the island is divided between three states. Until 1960, the island had been under the British Mandate, after which it became an independent state. However, 2% of the territory remained under the British military bases of Akrotiri and Decelia. De jure, the remaining part (98%), is to be owned by the independent Republic of Cyprus. However, de facto, since 1974, it has occupied only 60 percent of the island and a number of smaller islands: Ayios Georgios, Yeronisos, Glykiotissa, Kila, Klides, Kordhylia, and Mazaki. The northern part (36% of the territory) is controlled by the partially-recognized (only by Turkey) Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The north and south of the island are divided by the so-called \"green line\" \u2014 a buffer zone passing through the capital of Cyprus \u2014 Nicosia. This territory is under the control of a contingent of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).The Kyrenia mountain range stretches almost all over the island, and the Troodos mountain system is located in the south-west."

The first mention of Cyprus is found back in the works of Homer, so once you get to this ancient island, you feel like a hero of Greek mythology. The country amazes with the number of attractions in each, even the smallest, city.</p><h3>Nicosia</h3><p>The capital of Cyprus is Nicosia, located in the center of the country between the mountain ranges of Kyrenia and Troodos. There are many interesting cultural attractions here: the Archbishop's Palace, the Gallery of Modern Art, the Cyprus Archaeological Museum, and the Handicraft Center. But the most outstanding and, at the same time, tragic sight is the Green Line inside the Old City. It is a conventional strip, which is under the control of UN peacekeeping forces and divides the country into two parts \u2014 Greek and Turkish. The strip runs among winding alleys, colonial-era buildings, between churches and mosques, bars and street cafes. Sandbags and people in military uniforms are a reminder that it is worth paying attention while walking and getting to know Nicosia.&nbsp;</p><h3>Larnaca</h3><p>Larnaca is a major resort town and home to the largest international airport in the Republic of Cyprus. The modern area of Larnaca is located on the site of the ancient city-state of Kition. Every year, millions of tourists and pilgrims from different religions visit Larnaca. Here you shall find the famous Orthodox shrine \u2014 the Church of Saint Lazarus, built in the IX century on the site of the tomb of Lazarus, who, according to the Gospel of John, was resurrected by Jesus on the fourth day after his death. Here is also a part of his relics. Muslims come to Larnaka to visit their fourth most important shrine in the Islamic world, the Hala Sultan Tekke. The most interesting monument of Roman architecture is the Kamares Aqueduct, which is located near Salt Lake and Mackenzie Beach. The lake attracts a large population of pink flamingos in winter. Like many resort towns, Larnaca has a luxurious Finikoudes Promenade, a yacht marina, chic municipal beaches, many restaurants, and cafes offering a variety of national dishes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ayia Napa</h3><p>Ayia Napa is the most popular resort town in Cyprus with many high-class hotels, restaurants, bars, cafes, and nightclubs. Here you can scuba dive, windsurf, and water ski, visit the luna park and Europe's largest water theme park, Water World. In addition to active entertainment, you can visit, for example, the Ayia Napa Monastery and the Ethnographic Museum for cultural enrichment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Protaras</h3><p>Not far from Ayia Napa is the village of Protaras, famous for its golden beaches and clean water. This resort is not so full of nightclubs and bars and is more focused on a measured family holiday. The locals also like to spend time here. On the top of a large mountain, in the heart of the city, is the Church of St. Elijah, the Prophet XIV, which offers a beautiful view.</p><h3>Limassol</h3><p>Limassol, the main sea gate of Cyprus, is the center of trade of the island, the center of offshore companies, a popular resort, as well as a recognized center of wine-making in the country. Annually, in September, a wine festival is held here. The embankment, or rather its western part, where the sculpture park (Molos) is located, is one of the favorite places of tourists and locals. In the vicinity of the city, you can also see several interesting sights \u2014 Kolossi Castle, Ancient Kourion, and the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates.</p><h3>Paphos</h3><p>Paphos is a SPA town for lovers of ancient history and archaeology. Here you will find Villa Dionysus, the mosaics of which amaze with their beauty and splendor, House of Theseus, Tombs of the Kings, dating back to III century BC, the Holy Garden \u2014 Geroskipou. But the most popular attraction is the Baths of Aphrodite, which is a cave, with a small lake and a small waterfall.</p><h3>Pano Lefkara</h3><p>On the slope of the Troodos mountain range lies the picturesque village of Pano Lefkara, buried in olive plantations and orange gardens. The name is translated from Greek as \"White Mountains\". The village is named after the white limestone from the mountains. This material was used to build the majority of the houses and even to pave the streets. In Lefkara, there is the ancient Church of the Holy Cross, where the Orthodox shrine, a fragment of the Crucifixion, is kept. But the main thing that attracts art lovers and tourists from all over the world is the famous lace, the secret of weaving of which is passed on from generation to generation. It is said that in 1481, Leonardo da Vinci himself came to Lefkara to get acquainted with this art and took the local handmade lace from here for the altar of the Cathedral of Milan. In 2009, the Lefkaritica lacemaking technique was inscribed on the UNESCO's Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The main male trade in Lefkar is the production of silver filigree products. Both are available at numerous Lefkara shops.&nbsp;</p><h3>Troodos mountain range</h3><p>The southernmost ski resort in Europe is the Troodos mountain range. The season here lasts from December to March. It is not the most active skiing resort, but it has its own charm \u2014 mild climate, forest landscapes, and, most importantly - a small number of people. From here, you can go for a walk to nearby villages, each of which is known for something different: Omodos \u2014 wine, Lefkara \u2014 lace, Agros \u2014 a variety of meat dishes. In summer, people come here to climb Mount Olympos and enjoy a breathtaking view, which is a worthy reward for climbing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Akamas Peninsula</h3><p>Akamas Peninsula is the National Park near Paphos, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is no agricultural land on its territory, and nature is untouched. The pathway of Aphrodite and Adonis are two of the most popular walking routes for tourists. After the walk, you can swim in the Blue Lagoon with the purest turquoise water.</p>"

It is now a completely Albanian city, with the main street named after former American President Bill Clinton. He, like all successive United States authorities, is greatly respected by the local population. There is a portrait of him on Bill Clinton Boulevard and a monument to the former President underneath it. Perpendicular to Clinton Boulevard is George Bush Street.\n        <p>This is not a classical European capital. Prishtina looks more like a small provincial city. In the center, you can easily meet a cow or see clothes drying. The city is not clean at all, and there is a lot of garbage on the streets and buildings look untidy.</p><p>The most significant place in Prishtina is the Newborn Monument symbolizing the birth of the new state. It even received the Golden Lion at the 55th International Advertising Festival \"Cannes Lions\". The inscription is repainted every year. First, it was yellow, and then it was painted with the flags of the states that recognized the independence of Kosovo. In 2017, the letters were painted grey and placed horizontally \"N\" and \"W\", which started the inscription \"No Walls\", painted white on the ground.</p><p>Across the street from Newborn Monument, one can see the Heroinat installation dedicated to 20,000 Kosovo women who were victims of violence during the 1998-1999 war. The memorial is composed of medals placed on rods, which together form a three-dimensional portrait of a woman.</p><p>Prishtina is also famous for another symbol that is often included in the lists of the world's ugliest buildings, the National Library of Kosovo. It combines Albanian and Serbian architectural styles. The building looks like a cluster of separate rectangles fenced with metal wire mesh, with white domes of different sizes.</p><h3>Prizren</h3><p>Prizren is the capital of culture, the second-oldest city in the Republic, where the medieval spirit has been preserved. In order to better understand and see Prizren in all its glory, you need to climb the fortress wall, which offers an incredible panorama \u2014 cozy little white houses with terracotta roofs, mosques, temples, and the river. This is also the best location where you can watch the sunset over the mountains. The symbolic place of Prizren is an old stone bridge of the XV century, which is painted in most of the pictures. It was destroyed in the 1970s, but it was restored in 1982. Even though now the city is predominantly Muslim, in addition to mosques, ancient Orthodox churches and Catholic churches have been preserved here.</p><h3>Pec</h3><p>Pec is the town where the residence of the Patriarchate of Pec is located, from which the Serbian Orthodox Church began. In addition to cult objects, the city attracts tourists with its active and sometimes extreme pastimes \u2014 bungee jumping, zip-lines, hiking, paragliding, excursions to caves, etc. On Saturdays, at the local market, you can taste incredibly delicious homemade cheeses.</p><h3>Kosovska Mitrovica</h3><p>Kosovska Mitrovica is the city to which people most often go to see the difference between the country's structures. The river divides Mitrovica into two parts, the southern (Albanian) and northern (Serb). In the south, Albanians from all over the country like to celebrate weddings because of the low prices. Here they usually pay with euro and pray to Allah. On the other bank of the Ibar River, a completely different life flows - with a different culture, currency, language, and alphabet. And instead of mosques, there are Orthodox cathedrals.</p>"

You should start your walk around the city on Jauniela Street, where houses with colored facades are located. You can taste national cuisine and buy handmade souvenirs at the craft fair, which is held every Saturday in the Kalnciema Quarter. The symbol of the capital and the main attraction of the city is the House of Blackheads.\n        The building, constructed in 1334, amazes with a combination of different styles and luxurious interior items: crystal chandeliers, painted ceilings, and so on. These walls regularly host various events, concerts, and exhibitions.\n\n<h3>Daugavpils</h3><p>Daugavpils is Latvia's second-largest and most important city, located on the bank of the Daugava River. Daugavpils fortress is the symbol of the town and an architectural monument of national importance erected in the XIX century. The city has the oldest and the largest museum in the Latgale region. There are collections devoted to numismatics, archaeology, bonistics, and ethnography. The most popular exhibitions are dedicated to the peculiarities of life of the indigenous population of Daugavpils. The Latgale Zoo is suitable for walking with a child, where you can see macaques, marsupial possums, caimans, pythons, and other representatives of fauna that live here in artificially-created conditions of wild nature.</p><h3>Jurmala</h3><p>Coming to Latvia and not visiting Jurmala is like flying to Rome and not seeing the Colosseum. The resort city of Jurmala is known not only for its recreation on the Baltic coast but also for the popular singing contest \"New Wave\", which had been held here from 2002 to 2014. You can start by walking along Jomas Street, the busiest place in the city. There are cafes, restaurants, and shops on both sides. You should definitely take a walk in Dzintari Park, where centuries-old pine trees grow, and there is also a tall tower with an observation deck. As for the beaches of Jurmala, they are wide and clean here, and the average water temperature in the Baltic Sea in summer is +21 \u00b0C.</p><h3>Liepaja</h3><p>Liepaja is Latvia's third-largest city, located in the western part of the country. The name translates from Latvian as \"the city under the lindens\". There are indeed many of these trees here, as well as other green plants. Liepaja is famous for its mineral waters, beautiful beaches, and therapeutic mud. Lovers of cultural recreation will be pleased with the Seaside Park with its narrow streets and the Liepaja Holy Trinity Cathedral of the XVIII century with its magnificent organ. The most significant attraction of the city is the Liepaja Castle, built in the late XIX and early XX centuries by order of Russian Emperor Alexander III. The structure was severely damaged during the Second World War, so tourists can only see its fragments. The Karosta Prison, where the tours are conducted, is also impressive. This is the only military prison in Europe, from which no one has ever escaped.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sigulda</h3><p>Another quiet town to visit in Latvia is Sigulda, located 50 km from Riga, on the left bank of the Gauja River. This place is suitable for weekend walks. The town offers a lot to see and do. You can start by visiting the XIII century Sigulda Castle, or rather what is left of it. Only the south-west building with Gothic-style windows and the main tower at the gate have survived to this day. It is noteworthy that the territory is inhabited by Latvian youth, who try to restore the traditions of their people: they cook food at the campfire, fight with swords in armor. In a few steps from the castle, there is the Sigulda Palace, built in 1878-1881, which was the residence of the Kropotkin Princes. You should continue your walk in Turaida Museum Reserve. There is a castle, a sculpture garden, an estate, and an observation deck from which you can enjoy a beautiful panorama.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ventspils</h3><p>Ventspils is a small port town, which has become a resort not so long ago. In the central part is the Market Square, where you can buy original souvenirs. Within a 10-minute walk from the square, there is the Livonian Order Castle, built in 1290. In the port, anyone can go for a boat ride on the Venta River. One of the modern attractions of Ventspils is the colorful cow sculptures located all over the city. They started to be installed after the \"Cow Parade\" held in 2002. Both adults and children like to be photographed near the cows.</p>"

The bridge survived the earthquake and has preserved the Mother Teresa Memorial House and the Kale Fortress with its beautiful view.\n\n<h3>Bitola</h3><p>Bitola is the second-largest city in Macedonia. It is located near the border with Greece on a low mountain plateau. The most famous attraction is the ruins of the ancient city of Heraclea Lyncestis. Of course, not much is left of the ancient buildings, but here you can see the Roman amphitheater, baths, and portico. These lands often suffered from the invasion of the Tatars, so there are mosques left on the territory. The Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque is the most famous one, built in the middle of the XVI century. In the same period, a clock was installed in the center of the city, which to this day, gathers Muslims for prayer.</p><h3>Kumanovo</h3><p>Another picturesque town in Northern Macedonia is Kumanovo, 35 km north of Skopje. The area is famous for its mineral water, which was named after the town \u2014 \"Kumanovka\". The main streets of Kumanovo still bear the history to this day: the majority of the buildings date back to the XIX century. You can learn more about Kumanovo in the national museum. And if you have time, go and see Kokino, an archaeological monument, which is about 3800 years old.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ohrid</h3><p>Ohrid is a town on the shore of the blue lake of the same name, with picturesque houses around it. The lake is one of the most famous sights in Europe and is under UNESCO protection. The city itself is the main resort center of Macedonia. The ancient amphitheater, where magical musical evenings are held, is a real trademark. A beautiful view opens from Samoil's Fortress, which is often depicted on souvenir cards. Ohrid is home to the Robevi House, built in the XIX century. The building is an example of classical architecture, inside which there is a national museum with priceless artifacts. Here you can see gold postmortem masks, minted silver cups, bronze helmets, and collections of coins.</p><h3>Tetovo</h3><p>Tetovo is a city in northwest Macedonia, located at the foot of the \u0160ar Mountains. It was founded around the Church of the Holy Virgin in the XIII century as a small Orthodox town. But, already in the XIV century, the Ottoman Empire conquered these lands, after which the rapid construction of mosques, baths, and markets began. The monastery of the Islamic order of Bektashi dervishes \u2014 the Arabati Baba Te\u1e31eand and the Decorated Mosque (\u0160arena D\u017eamija) remained to this day. There are many cozy cafes in Tetovo, the owners of which offer to taste local dishes \u2014 do not deny yourself this pleasure.</p>"

If Italy's borders resemble a shoe, Malta's borders look like a trail left by this very shoe. Indeed, not only Italy left its mark in the history and culture of Malta. Turkey, France, led by Napoleon, and of course, Great Britain, whose colony the country had been until the 70s of the XX century, have also left their marks. Fans of ancient architecture, as well as divers, yachtsmen, and climbers, will find here entertainment to their liking. Malta is ideal for all types of recreation and is ready to welcome tourists all year round."

The islands of Gozo and Comino are also considered inhabited. The islands of Saint Paul and Filfla, Cominotto, Filfoletta are so tiny that no one lives there. Malta is considered to be the smallest state in Europe, which is only 27 km long and 15 km wide. Gozo is half as little, and Comino is barely 2 km long. It is the only country in Europe without natural rivers and lakes. The typical landscape of Malta is the numerous steep stone slopes that attract climbers from all over the world. The highest point, Ta' Dmejrek peak, reaches a height of only 253 meters. Malta is divided into six districts, three regions, and 68 municipalities."

            "en": "<p>Despite the tiny size of the state, there are still big cities here. The density of historical buildings per square meter here is so high that not only individual sights are under UNESCO protection, but the whole town.&nbsp;</p><h3>Valletta</h3><p>Valletta is the capital of the island state of Malta, which was founded back in the XVI century by the Order of the Knights of St. John making it one of the largest and oldest ports in the Mediterranean. The name of the city is directly linked to the founding knight, Jean Parisot de la Valletta. He also led an army that protected the port from the Turkish invasion. This fortress city is so densely built up with castles and ancient architectural structures, which have been preserved in their original form, that it was fully included in the program of protection of the World Organization UNESCO. Because the streets in Valletta are very narrow, locals and tourists travel here mainly on foot or in horse-drawn carriages. However, the capital is worth visiting not only for fans of ancient architecture but also for all those who want to learn English. Due to the long stay in the status of a British colony, English is the second state language in Malta. Valletta offers a large number of schools, colleges, gymnasiums, and universities, which annually admit hundreds of thousands of students from around the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mdina</h3><p>Mdina is the former capital of Malta, with only 306 inhabitants. It has many palaces, cathedrals, a unique city gate, and a variety of museums that tell the story of the past of the Knights of the Order of Malta. You can access the city-fortress through the City and the Greek Gates. It's an interesting fact that locals walked through the City Gate, and only slaves walked through the Greek Gate. Despite its tiny size, Mdina has an impressive number of palaces: Vilhena Palace, Xara Palace, Palazzo Santa Sofia, Palazzo Inguanez. All buildings were erected in 1726-1729. In the past, the constructions were barracks and hospitals, and today some of them have been converted into hotels, while others are home to noble Maltese families. The cathedral in Mdina is wrapped in secrets and legends. This is where Paul the Apostle, who arrived in Malta after his shipwreck, supposedly stayed. A majestic and silent city \u2014 this is the name of the first capital of Malta, which is worth visiting for all fans of solitude and thoughtful rest.</p><h3>Sliema</h3><p>Sliema used to be a small fishing village in the past. It has now become the main recreation and shopping center in Malta. It is home to dozens of modern hotels for tourists, and the holiday season lasts all year round. The Roman Catholic past greatly influenced the architecture of the city. Typical cathedrals, palaces, and baroque towers are scattered throughout the city. Fort Tign\u00e9 was erected to protect the city from the French invasion in 1793-1795. It is one of the oldest polygonal defensive structures in the world. It is in excellent condition nowadays and attracts tourists from all over the world. In addition to historical buildings, there is a luxurious waterfront with a monument \"White Shadows\". The carved human silhouettes cast white shadows only early in the morning or in winter when the sun is very low. Not many people know about this feature of the monument.&nbsp;</p><h3>Saint Julian's</h3><p>Saint Julian's is a resort city located along the Mediterranean coast, close to the capital of Malta, where many tourists strive for recreation. Due to the mild climate, the island state is also popular in winter. St. Julians is famous for its luxurious hotels and bustling parties. The resort has the well-preserved buildings of the past, numerous chapels, and churches, as well as the renowned monument of Love, set on the waterfront. It represents large inverted letters LOVE. To see the inscription correctly, you need to look at the reflection in the water. By the way, not many tourists know about this trick. Palazzo Dragonara, Spinola Palace, and Lapsi Church are the main architectural sights of the city. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is another iconic place. The majestic building in Neo-Gothic style is located on the shore of a picturesque bay on the promenade. St. Julians is an ideal resort for young people and gamblers, as here you shall find the largest casinos in the country.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mellieha</h3><p>Mellieha is a popular tourist destination where historical ensembles of sanctuaries and palaces meet together with luxurious hotels and resorts. One of the main attractions of Mellieja is the Grotto of Madonna. Pilgrims from all over the world come here to see the shrine. There is a statue of the Virgin Mary inside the natural cave, illuminated by hundreds of candles. Moreover, there is also a brook in the grotto, which, according to legends, is considered to be miraculous. It can be accessed at any time of day, unlike other churches that only open their doors during divine services. In addition to the traditional Roman Catholic churches, there is the G\u0127adira Nature Reserve, where migratory birds live. Tourists can also visit the numerous towers scattered throughout the city, Fort Campbell and Armier Bay, where pirates used to rest.</p>"

It is the main hub of the political, financial, and commercial life of the country, its cultural and educational center. It has the main museums and theatres of Moldavia, and there is also an organ hall. There are many restaurants and cafes, supermarkets and small shops in the city. Architecturally, the city is quite diverse.\n        Here you can find fascinating buildings of pre-revolutionary and Soviet period, and in the upper part of the town, you will come across very extraordinary modern skyscrapers. The ancient Orthodox temples should be specially noted among the historical monuments. There are 23 lakes within the city borders, and not far from its outskirts, there is the Ghidighici Reservoir. In addition, Chisinau is one of the greenest cities in Europe, and its magnificent Botanical Garden has more than 10 thousand species of plants. Wide streets dressed in green velvet, numerous parks and squares, bright flower beds, and romantic lakes turned Chisinau into a wonderful place for a quiet family holiday.\n\n<h3>Bender</h3><p>If you are interested in history and come to Moldova, you should definitely visit Bender. It is an ancient city, first mentioned in 1408. It is located on the left bank of the Dniester River and is now part of the PMR. Bender is the main port on the Dniester River, a major railway junction, and a city of manufacturing. There are not many sights there, except for several memorials to the victims of various wars \u2014 from the Russian-Turkish wars to the civil war of 1991-1992. But there is the Bendery Fortress within the city's borders, which attracts tourists here. It was built back in the XVI century by the Turks to control Bessarabia, and until the second half of the XVIII century, it had been invincible. Then, during several wars with the Turks, it was taken three times by the Russian troops. The fortress has a large area, it is well-preserved to this day, and since 2008, it has been reconstructed in the PMR.&nbsp;</p><h3>Balti</h3><p>Balti is a large industrial center, the second-largest city in the country by population, which is called the \"northern capital\" of Moldova. Balti is crossed by the Raut River and its inlets Rautel, Cop\u0103ceanca, and Flemynde. The city's central square is one of the largest in Europe. There are several ancient and modern temples in Balti. They include the delightful Saint Constantine and Elena Cathedral, as well as the very beautiful and unusual modern Archangels Michael and Gabriel Church. The town has enough good restaurants and cafes with national, European, and Japanese cuisines. In general, Balti is a very cozy city.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tiraspol</h3><p>Tiraspol is the capital of the unrecognized PMR. Despite the difficulties caused by the economic isolation of the republic, the city continues to develop. In recent years, new modern buildings have been erected here. In general, Tiraspol does not overwhelm with architectural beauty, most of the buildings date back to the Soviet period, but the city is clean and tidy. There are several impressive monuments in the town, particularly to the Russian commander Suvorov. In any case, it's curious to see how the unrecognized republic lives.&nbsp;</p><h3>Soroca</h3><p>Soroca is a small ancient town, located on the right bank of the Dniester River, may compete with Chisinau for the title of the greenest city in the country and Europe, and it is still unknown who will win. The city is literally drowning in greenery. Despite its modest size, the city will please tourists with a number of interesting buildings, though modern. And its pearl is the Soroca Fort, built by the ruler of the Moldavian Principality Stephen the Great, at the end of the XV century.</p>"

The main attractions are collected in the Old Town, at the top of Saint-Antoine: the luxurious white-stone Prince's Palace of Monaco, where the royal family lives, the Oceanographic Museum, which had been headed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau himself for some time, one of the oldest buildings of the city \u2014 Chapel of Mercy and Monaco Cathedral of Saint Nicholas. It's a pleasure to walk along the winding streets of Monaco-Ville.\n        Every building here is an architectural and historical monument. Chic mountain landscapes and salty sea breeze will add some extra euphoria.\n\n<h3>Monte Carlo</h3><p>Monte Carlo is a city celebrated in cinematography, a luxurious town of betting of the black. In the XIX century, Prince Charles III Grimaldi built a casino on a hill, among the sheep pastures. Since then, it is a favorite place for the power players, who arrive at the palace not in coaches, but in the gorgeous cars. Monte Carlo has the best restaurants and the most expensive hotels in the Principality, high-fashion houses and glamorous clubs. In addition to being the center of the gambling industry, Monte Carlo has established itself as an elite resort on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. There is a belief that only in Monaco, you can get an even tan without painful burns. So hurry up to the accessible municipal beach of Larvotto and start soaking in some vitamin D.&nbsp;</p><h3>La Condamine</h3><p>While residents and visitors spend their fortunes in Monte Carlo and show off their intelligence at festivals in Monaco, the La Condamine area is responsible for the economy of the whole country. Respectable and balanced, it is an incredible contrast to other districts. Here you can find the headquarters of banks and large companies, key businesses, and shopping malls. La Condamine is a real business-machine. And it looks like it's not going to stop. Every year, the area grows due to artificial mounds. La Condamine will please you with its prices: compared to the luxury resorts of Monaco, restaurants, and hotels are much more budget-friendly. And there's plenty to see here too: the oldest Port Hercule in the Principality's districts; the Pedestrian Street Rue Princess Caroline with orange trees; St. Nicholas Cathedral, known as the tomb of the princes of Monaco.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fontvieille</h3><p>The phenomenon of Fontvieille is that the locals conquered its land from the sea. The contrast between Fontvieille and other parts of Monaco is evident to you. It looks more like a country village than an advanced industrial center, as it is generally considered. The Italians and the French love this quiet harbor. Partying here is less noisy than sporting events. Football matches at the Stade Louis II, international athletics starts, and mountaineering competitions gather thousands of fans. Amateurs and professionals have fun conquering the steep cliffs of Grimaldi. Top attractions in Fontvieille also include hang-gliding. And for those who prefer an educational and lazy holiday, the doors of museums and city parks are always open.</p>"

The city, like all Scandinavia, is quite restrained and simple, although this doesn't detract from its northern charm. In Oslo, you won't find the fancy bohemian architectural forms that other European capitals are rich in. With a rather modest baseline, the Norwegians were able to create a city with a zest.\n        You'll probably be interested to see the futuristic Opera House, partially sunken into the water, the classic building of the Norwegian Parliament, the elegant halls of the City Hall, and the graffiti-painted Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka quarter. You should also definitely visit Ekebergparken Sculpture Park, Munch Museum, the Kon-Tiki, and Fram Museums, dedicated to Viking ships.\n\n<h3>Bergen</h3><p>The North Sea coast is home to Bergen, the former capital of Norway and the current \"capital of rains\", with 270 days of rainfall a year. It is at least worth stopping by for a stroll along the UNESCO World Heritage Quay of Bryggen. It is a merchant's quarter with facades facing the sea that dates back to the Hanseatic League era. At the very least, you can eat the freshest seafood bought at the Fish Market and feed the gulls at Lake Lille Lungeg\u00e5rdsvannet in the city park. It makes sense to take the funicular to Mount Fl\u00f8yen, which offers fabulous views of the furry hills and bright houses of the city. If you're lucky enough to get to a concert by the famous Bergen Symphony Orchestra, you'll have a real treat!</p><p>But there's more to it than that. Bergen is a living \"gateway to the kingdom of fjords.\" This is where all sorts of sea tours along the coast of Norway begin. Whether it's a tour of the nearby fjords for a couple of hours or a full trip to Hardanger and Sognefjord for a few days - the captain of the ship is waiting for you in Bergen.</p><h3>R\u00f8ros</h3><p>Back in 1644, the mining town, which managed to preserve its unique atmosphere to this day, was founded in the mountains of Norway. We are talking about R\u00f8ros \u2014 a living museum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tourists are attracted here by the serenity floating over the smooth surface of picturesque lakes and rivers, the majesty of the mountains hanging over their heads, and a thick, slender forest, drowned in the mist. The town with a dozen authentic wooden houses does not have much entertainment. In winter, locals offer dog sledding trips, and in summer, cycling along the mountain trails. And we recommend taking the legendary M/S F\u00e6mund ferry on Lake Femund, Norway's third-largest.</p><h3>Troms\u00f8</h3><p>Troms\u00f8 is the main city of Northern Norway. In summer, the sun shines here around the clock, and in winter, the sky is bursting with the magical waves of northern lights. There are many bars, night clubs, restaurants, and discos in the city, where the local brewery has been supplying an excellent drink for 100 years. The Arctic Cathedral is the irreplaceable symbol of Troms\u00f8, a work of architectural art that looks like an iceberg. The International Film Festival and Northern Lights Festival should be included in the cultural program of the city, and families with children are recommended to visit the polar zoo.</p><p>Just outside the city limits, the wild polar nature begins. Climbers come here to conquer the majestic Mount St\u00f8ren; extreme climbers are attracted by hiking along the arctic ridge of the Lyngen Alps. For those who are not addicted to adrenaline rush, Troms\u00f8 organizes walks on foothill trails and cruises on the Lyngenfjord.</p><h3>Stavanger</h3><p>Stavanger is the largest city in Western Norway and the oil capital of the country. The town itself is better known for its surroundings. Here you can find one of the most famous Norwegian fjords \u2014 Lysefjord, with Preikestolen steep cliff hanging over it, which is also known as Pulpit Rock. From Stavanger, you can take trips to Rogaland County, where a huge Kjeragbolten stone is stuck between the Kjerag cliffs, at an altitude of 984 meters.&nbsp;</p><h3>Trondheim</h3><p>In Trondheim, the city of students and the cultural capital of Norway, life hits the spotlight on the weekends. It is rich in sightseeing. Nidaros Cathedral, Scandinavia's oldest shrine, has been decorating Trondheim with its Gothic facades for over ten centuries. The green labyrinths of the northernmost Botanical Garden in the world are located nearby. The Music Museum is ready to share its knowledge about ancient musical instruments with everyone. Trondheim is the ideal city for leisurely walks and silent contemplation of the charming architecture that has grown against the background of unbridled Norwegian nature. So don't hesitate to visit!&nbsp;</p><h3>\u00c5lesund</h3><p>According to Norwegians, \u00c5lesund is the most beautiful city. It was destroyed by a fire a hundred years ago and then rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style. One of the city trams can help you explore the fairy-like streets of \u00c5lesund. It will rush you along the main attractions \u2014 Queen Sonja Square, Museum, City Park, and the only building that survived the fire. Make sure you climb the observation deck on Mount Aksla and visit the Atlantic Oceanarium, where you can take out the maritime inhabitants from the bottom of the sea, stroke the head of the stingrays, look at the two-meter-high Anarhichas and feel the sea cucumbers.</p><p>One of the most visited fjords in Norway, Geiranger Fjord, is 100 km from \u00c5lesund. Here, the waterfalls of Seven Sisters, the Suitor, and the Bridal Veil cry with lush streams, the Flydalsjuvet Rock floating above the fjord's surface, and the unique mountain landscapes are strictly protected by UNESCO.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lillehammer</h3><p>Lillehammer is cozily settled deep in the country, among the mountains. A Viking on skis, depicted on the emblem of the city, hints that Lillehammer is the center of skiing in Norway. In 1994, Lillehammer hosted the Winter Olympic Games, and today the resort of Sjusj\u00f8en is open to every lover of downhill skiing.</p><h3>Lofoten Islands</h3><p>The red houses of authentic villages, whale safaris (the ones where you go out for photo hunting), fishing, and the crystal purity of nature \u2014 all this is waiting for you in the Lofoten Islands.

            "en": "<h3>Lisbon</h3>\n\nLisbon is the capital of Portugal. It is a city of inspiration, warm sun, white and blue facades, and red roofs. There's no need to worry about getting lost. Whichever alley you turn in, you're in the right place: on the terrace of the ancient Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m or by the Rua Augusta Arch on the Pra\u00e7a do Comercio, under the broken vaults of the Carmo Convent or by the white walls of the majestic Basilica da Estrela. So, get lost and remember that Lisbon is a city of aesthetic walks, where life is at the moment.\n        Here's a grey Portuguese man who sells hand-made ceramics in an old shop near the Feira da Ladra, further up the hill, like a crown, tower the high walls of the Moorish castle of S\u00e3o Jorge. In the evening, the stone streets of Alfama, which until recently had been ringing the horns of traditional yellow trams, are filled with melancholy Fado tunes.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Sintra</h3><p>Lisbon is hard to get tired of, but for a change, we recommend a day trip to Sintra, the favorite holiday destination of the Portuguese kings. The panorama of this city seems to have come down from the pages of the fairytale of princesses and dragons. On the green hills, in the foggy forests, you can see the towers of family estates, the walls of fortresses, and ancient castles. At the very top stands the pearl of Sintra, the Pena Palace. Its bright facades witnessed the fall of the monarchy a hundred years ago and today provide a popular background for Instagram's pictures. Absolutely opposite in its atmosphere, the mystical Quinta da Regaleira hides in the dense park, famous for its secret underground passages, inverted towers, and Masonic stories. There is a lighthouse 20 minutes away from Sintra. There is a stele underneath it, which declares: \"You are on the edge of Europe.\" This is Cape Roca, where the wind throws the dust of the ocean in your face, the height of the rocks make you dizzy, and the borderless Atlantic gives you hope for a promising future.</p><h3>Porto</h3><p>Porto lives in the north of Portugal, the region where the independence of this sunny country was born. The portrait of this city is intoxicating: the ancient, half-ruined estates laid down by the founders adjoin the restored glossy villas, the azulejo paintings on the facades look spectacular against the backdrop of massive iron bridges, and the labyrinths of the streets lead to the wine shops, where port wine flows over the edge. Once upon a time, it was this city that inspired J. Rowling to write Harry Potter. Perhaps, the view of fog-shrouded Porto from the window of an old wooden tram running to the ocean will inspire you to magic too?</p><h3>Coimbra</h3><p>Coimbra is the former capital of Portugal and the current university city. Here, one architectural monument stands on the other one, and the landscapes of the streets are so beautiful that you unintentionally start to regret that you do not know how to photograph with your eyes. Coimbra is the cradle of the Portuguese mentality when they sing the most soulful Fado and know everything about Saudade. Such regalia obliges the city to keep its face, but only until sunset: at night, it explodes with students' parties and festivals.</p><h3>Algarve</h3><p>If you are looking for a family holiday destination, do not hesitate to choose the Algarve. It is the southernmost region in Portugal. It smells of freedom, oranges, and almond plantations. The largest city in the Algarve is Faro. This resort can boast of gorgeous sandy beaches and lagoons, luxury hotels and golf courses, cozy fish restaurants, and authentic architecture. Make sure your cultural program includes the Estoi Palace in Rococo style, and Igreja do Carmo \u2014 a temple made of gold leaf and a luxurious example of Baroque architecture. The water park and Zoomarine Park are worth visiting with children. If you are looking for a party to crash, you should take a trip to neighboring Albufeira or Portim\u00e3o.</p><h3>Azores</h3><p>Portugal has its own treasure chest. It is the Azores, an archipelago of nine islands in the rebellious waters of the Atlantic Ocean. There's almost no civilization here, and to tell you the truth, you won't need it at all. After all, the Azores are designed to breathe to the fullest extent, to look at the underwater world with a tank behind your back, climbing caves, in the depths of which the underground geysers beat, roam on the edge of the crater of the volcano and scuba dive with cachalots and whales in the waters of the archipelago.</p><h3>Madeira</h3><p>Eco-tourism, surfing, gastro-tourism, diving, a cultural program, and lazy beach relaxation \u2014 this is a short list of opportunities Madeira offers you. A lush green island towers over the ocean a thousand kilometers off the coast of Europe. The capital of Madeira is the city of Funchal. It will captivate you from your first stroll through its ancient streets: the fantastic garden of the Colonial Quinta do Palheiro and Orchid Garden, the Fort of S\u00e3o Tiago, and the Cathedral from Funchal (S\u00e9), the picturesque Cape Cabo Girao and the Valley of the Nuns. The only drawback of the resort is that there are no equipped beaches at all. If you want to sunbathe, you'll have to go to the neighboring island of Porto Santo.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Ljubljana</h3>\n\nLjubljana is the capital of Slovenia. It is located almost in the heart of the country and is a convenient starting point for further trips. Locals call Ljubljana \"the dragon city\". The legend has it that Jason, the hero of the ancient Greek myths, performed his next heroic feat by killing a dragon in Ljubljana. Numerous sculptures and images scattered all over the city remind us of this. And the Dragon Bridge is guarded by four such creatures at once. The Ljubljana Castle, located on a hill, is worth exploring.\n        As a reward for crossing 150 steps, you will enjoy a magnificent view of the city from the observation deck. Right at the foot of the hill lies the old town with its medieval streets and unique architecture. The Triple Bridge is another iconic place in the Slovenian capital. Coming out from one point on one bank, turning in a fan on the other, it goes to three different places.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Maribor</h3><p>Maribor is the second-largest city in the country. Just like in the capital, the castle of the XV century that now houses a museum attracts the attention of travelers here in the first place. Besides, the XVI century Town Hall, the XII century Gothic Saint John Baptist Cathedral, and Vodnik Square, where the market is open in the mornings, are waiting for tourists. Here, as a souvenir, you can buy a bottle of excellent local wine, for the production of which Maribor is famous. The local wine cellars are considered to be the largest in Central Europe, and there are vineyards by the river, which are 400 years old. Thanks to the vineyards, Maribor is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest city in the world, which produces wine uninterruptedly. Maribor will also be interesting for ski lovers, as there is one of the most popular ski centers in its surroundings \u2014 \"Maribor Pohorje\". And lovers of less active leisure will be offered unique healing therapies.</p><h3>Celje</h3><p>Celje is the third-largest city in Slovenia. The small and cozy town of Celje lies at the foot of a hill on which Celje Castle, one of the largest castles in the country, stands. In addition to it, Celje has interesting museums, ancient churches, and cozy parks. Three rivers merge right within the city limits, reinforcing the beauty of the human-made and the beauty of nature. In the vicinity of Celje, there is another tourist attraction, the 90-meter Rinka Falls.&nbsp;</p><h3>Koper</h3><p>Koper is the largest seaside resort town and the main port in Slovenia. It is very close to Italy, so Italian speech can be heard here almost as often as Slovene. In the XIII century, Koper was part of Venice, and the Italian style appeared in local architecture from here. Some buildings, such as the Praetorian Palace and the Loggia Palace, have survived to this day. The oldest structure of the city, the Carmine Rotunda church, was built in the XII century, and another magnificent example of ancient architecture, the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was built in the XV century. By the way, previously the city was located on an island called Goat Island and only in 1825, was filled with a dam that connected it to the mainland and turned it into a peninsula. Although, up to now, the locals still divide the city into the mainland and island.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bled</h3><p>\"The Alpine Pearl\" is what the people of Slovenia call the town of Bled. Situated on the slopes of the Alps, on the banks of an emerald lake, surrounded by dense forests, it fascinates with its splendor. The aristocracy loved to come here for holidays even back in the Middle Ages. In the XX century, it was the residence of Josip Broz Tito, the head of Yugoslavia. Today, Bled is a popular balneological resort with healing thermal spring water and unique microclimate. In winter, it is a ski resort. This town is also trendy among newlyweds. They come here to spend their honeymoon. A small island in the middle of the lake with a picturesque XVII century church attracts them. According to a legend, if a husband carries his wife in his arms up the 99 steps from the pier to the church, he will be very happy in his marriage. And the \"bell of desire\" of the church will make any dream come true for the couple. It is worth devoting some time to a tour of Bled Castle, one of the most beautiful and oldest castles in Slovenia. Its observation deck offers a fascinating view.&nbsp;</p><h3>Portoro\u017e</h3><p>Portoro\u017e is the most fashionable resort in Slovenia. In Italian, the name of the city sounds like the \"Port of Roses\". They really do grow everywhere here. Recreational infrastructure is represented by SPA centers, beauty salons, unique springs with therapeutic mud, and thermal waters. People come here to relax and have fun on the beaches, in clubs, and water parks. Portoro\u017e is also famous for its casinos. Gambling lovers come here from all over the world, but the regulars here are still hot Italians. By the way, Portoro\u017e is a real paradise for the lovers of Mediterranean cuisine.&nbsp;</p><h3>Piran</h3><p>Piran is a tiny town, which is located half an hour's walk from Portoro\u017e. And it's a must-visit place. It also once belonged to the Republic of Venice, which left its mark on its image. The city fascinates by the color of the Middle Ages and by the almost total absence of vehicles, as the streets of Piran are very narrow. It is worth visiting Tartini Square, St. George's Parish Church, with the hourly bells ringing, and the Maritime Museum.</p>"

It is a leisurely Estonian city that lives on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland. It is truly a city of extremes, and the center of the capital is a real medieval island, clutched in the arms of modern glass skyscrapers. Kadriorg Palace, Great Sea Gate, Town Hall Square, St. Mary's Cathedral, Kalamaja and N\u00f5mme districts will take you back to several centuries. The beaches in the Haabersti and Pirita areas will make your head spin with the sea breeze, while a techno rave in a nightclub will remind you that you are in the XXI century. And make sure you climb the observation deck of Patkuli, which is on Toompea Hill. After all, the best way to admire Tallinn is from a height.&nbsp;</p><h3>P\u00e4rnu</h3><p>If you travel to Estonia in summer, it is a crime not to go to P\u00e4rnu, the country's main resort. The medieval town will welcome you with a carefree romantic atmosphere. Everything is relaxed here: numerous SPA and a water park, historic-style baths and cocktail bars, wide sandy beaches, and warm sea. In addition to sunbathing, make sure you include a bike ride along the picturesque promenade, sailing and canoe trips to the open sea by the river.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tartu</h3><p>Tartu is the oldest city in the Baltics states and the intellectual capital of Estonia. In a couple of hours, you can see all the sights: Old Town, University, Dorpat Cathedral, \"Falling House\", Town Hall Square, the embankment of the Emaj\u00f5gi River. And after that, you will find cozy cafes, craft shops, and sunset on Toomem\u00e4gi hill with a chic view of the city.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kuressaare</h3><p>Kuressaare (formerly Arensburg) is the main city of Saaremaa and the \"island capital\" of Estonia. Kuressaare, with its low-rise buildings, is more like a village with several gems in its box: the Baroque Town Hall, Vazhnya, St. Lawrence's Church, and, of course, the Kuressaare Episcopal Castle, from which the whole city grew up. But historical sights are not all that Saaremaa is rich in. Be sure to include a walk to the \"witch's lake\", Kaali Meteorite Crater, in your trip plan. Visit the picturesque coastline of the Panga Cliff and the Angla Windmill Park, a symbol of the region.</p><h3>Rakvere</h3><p>Rakvere divided the road between Tallinn and Narva in half. This humble city attracts tourists with the ruins of the medieval castle of Wesenberg. The place deserves attention by right: picturesque hills, the weight of fortress walls, cold dungeons, and historical theatrical performances will take you to the Middle Ages. You can test your inner knight's agility yourself. Here you will have an opportunity to shoot with an archer, try on ancient armor, feel the weight of the sword in the forge, and look into the torture chamber.&nbsp;</p><h3>Narva</h3><p>If you want something Russian in Estonia, go to Narva. The city is on the very border with Russia, so when you walk along the streets, sometimes you get lost: is it already St. Petersburg, or is it still Narva? The question is easy to understand: if you can see the tall tower of Hermann Castle, you are still on the Estonian land. The rich history of the city has left a legacy of fortifications of XIV-XVI centuries, the Baroque Town Hall of 1668, the Orthodox Resurrection of Christ Cathedral, the complex of buildings of the famous Kreenholm Manufacturing Company. If you still have the strength after seeing all the sights, go out to the promenade along the embankment. The city from the river, lit by evening lights, looks simply fabulous.</p>"

Their honesty, innocence, and incredible generosity will win every guest\u2019s heart.</p><h3>Jakarta</h3><p>Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and the most loaded city in the country. Officially, over ten million people live here. Besides, hundreds of thousands of tourists from every corner of the planet visit Jakarta daily. It\u2019s a multicultural city. Here you can see the largest mosque in Asia, a Buddhist temple, and a neo-Gothic National Cathedral. The main city attractions are located in the old districts like Kota and Sunda Kelapa. If your stay in the capital is limited in time, but you still want to dive into the cultural identity, visit Taman Mini \u201cIndonesia Indah\u201d. It\u2019s an enormous complex with miniature attractions and architectural constructions from various provinces of the state. Taking into account the size of the park, we highly recommend you to rent a bicycle. Local citizens are desperate shopaholics. That\u2019s why over 130 huge shopping malls work here round-the-clock. Just like any other Asian capital, Jakarta never sleeps. This loud and bright place can get your juices flowing for a year in advance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Denpasar</h3><p>Denpasar is the capital of Bali. Unlike the island that gathers many tourists who come for a sense of peace and self-cognition, Denpasar is far from the notion of \u201crelax\u201d. At the same time, it is ready to offer an authentic culture to its guests. The ancient temples here are mixed with fashionable constructions made of glass and concrete. And at the Pasar Badung market, you will not only taste the exotic street food but also can purchase authentic household items that the Balinese people had been using thousands of years ago. It\u2019s impossible not to visit the temples while you are in Denpasar. Pura Maospahit was made of corals in the XV century. It\u2019s devoted to the Balinese supreme god Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa. You can\u2019t skip Raja's Palace immersed in luxury grandeur. Denpasar is the city that managed to save its flavors and share it with its tourists.</p><h3>Ubud</h3><p>Ubud is a small but cozy town located in the highlands of Bali Island. Monkey Forest is the first thing that comes to our minds when somebody mentions this city. Primates freely wander around an enormous park and are more than happy to contact with human beings. A small life hack for travelers: Monkey Forest is a sacred place where they have daily rituals. Stay here till the evening, and you will definitely see one of the traditional Balinese ceremonies. This will help you dive even deeper into the local culture. Goa Gajah is another place with an ancient spirit. This temple complex with fonts is lost in the forest. You can explore this attraction for hours, enjoying the marvelous landscapes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Yogyakarta</h3><p>Yogyakarta is a city on Java island. Sultans\u2019 palaces, historical palaces included in UNESCO World Heritage List, museums, and beach resorts are located on the territory of 46 square kilometers. The magnificent Borobudur Temple that was built somewhere between 750 and 850, still impresses the scientists. These enormous constructions symbolize the system of the universe. Local citizens have a legend: \u201cA person who touches all Buddhas on the top floor will find eternal happiness\u201d. The Royal Palace of Sultan Kraton or Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat (1755) is the main raisin of Yogyakarta. It\u2019s still the official residence of the sultan. Fanciers of nature can go to the suburbs of Yogyakarta and visit Gembira Loka Zoo. It\u2019s one of the best zoos in Indonesia with a diversity of rare birds and mammals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Surabaya</h3><p>Surabaya is a port city on Java island. It is the second in size in Indonesia. This is a city of extremes where the colonial past mixed with skyscrapers, fishing villages, and ancient temples. Surabaya is divided into two districts: Chinese and Arabic. This area will appeal to the fanciers of architecture. Here you can observe a high concentration of churches, mosques, and temples. Ampel Mosque constructed in the XV century is the most iconic building. The artistic life of Surabaya is concentrated in the Old Town, where the Dutch colonial influence remains. If you are looking for an unforgettable atmosphere and exotics culinary delights, head to Pasar Ampel market. You can finish your tour near the longest highway bridge in Indonesia. It is 5438 meters in length. Its official title is Jembatan Nasional Suramadu. The bridge connects Java and Madura islands.&nbsp;</p><h3>Medan</h3><p>Medan is the largest city in Sumatra and the fourth largest in the size of the population in Indonesia. This place became a starting point for tourists who want to travel to other islands. It undeservingly left behind! At first sight, the city looks dirty and noisy. Few, if any, understand English. However, if you are looking for real extremes and flavors, you should definitely stay here a bit longer. Medan\u2019s streets still have the existing constructions in Art Deco style left from the Dutch colonizers: Maimoon Palace that used to be the residence of the sultan, the active Chinese temple Vihara Gunung Timur, and one of the oldest Hindu temples on the island. When you explore the streets of Medan, you realize that history is not in the books. History is right in front of you.</p>"

The territory of the country is washed by the seas of the Pacific Ocean: the Yellow, South China, and East China Seas, and the West Korea Bay of the Yellow Sea.

The most renowned and largest of them are Taiwan and Hainan.In the south, the People's Republic of China borders on Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam; in the southwest - Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan; in the west - Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. In the north, China borders on Mongolia, in the northeast - with Russia and North Korea, in the northwest - with Kazakhstan.

            "en": "<p>China is multifaced and diverse. It offers a diversity of fascinating and unique things: from the stone peaks of the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park to the flooded stairs of the Longji Rice Terraces; from the cosmic skyscrapers of Guangzhou to pandas chewing bamboo in Giant Panda Breeding Research Base; from the Great Wall of China to the peak of Mount Fanjing hidden in the clouds; from the Pacific Ocean to the Tian Shan's ridges. Start your acquaintance with this country with the largest megalopolises:</p><h3>Beijing</h3><p>Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the most important political, educational, and cultural center of the country. The past, present, and future are closely intertangled here. The futuristic building of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, the glass tower of China World Trade Center, bankings of the road interchanges, the technological Planetarium, and fuss of the business world - this technological modernity changes for traditional Chinese pagodas literally right around the corner. The majesty of the largest Imperial Palace complex in the world, the Forbidden City, the terracotta vaults of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Zen of the Temple of Heaven complex of religious buildings stand in stark contrast to the typical communistic constructions. Beijing, as a model capital, broadcasts the diversity of the Celestial Empire. You will need more than one day to get to know it closer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Shanghai</h3><p>Shanghai is the city of sins and Chinese New York. Standing at the mouth of the Yangtze River, at the coast of the Pacific Ocean, it rules the country's financial flow and conducts multimillion international deals. You can't mix up the image of Shanghai with any other city: spherical buildings, skyscrapers of the Pudong district, multi-leveled road interchanges, avenues filled with luminescent light. It keeps its Chinese charm within the walls of the Jade Buddha Temple and houses of old Nanshi District. Still, Shanghai gets a peep of the west and tries to take the best of it. There is almost no communistic spirit here, and there are more bars and nightclubs here than temples in Beijing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hong Kong</h3><p>Hong Kong is a special administrative region in the south of China. Surrounded by the mountains and the ocean, it includes not only the same-name island, but also Lantau Island, the Kowloon Peninsula, New Territories, and around 260 smaller islands. It had been developing under the influence of Great Britain for such a long time, that it considers itself to be the Chinese-non-China. The region has a separate currency, writing system, electoral system, and economy. The built-up density in Hong Kong is so high that you don't understand where one skyscraper ends and another begins. But everything changes when you ascend to Victoria Peak. Myriads of sparkling lights of the big city look incredible at a set of sun, against the picturesque harbor, drown in the damp haze.</p><h3>Island of Hainan</h3><p>When the color of your skin turns grey and dims from the concrete landscapes of megalopolises, leave everything and come to the island of Hainan. This is a real paradise with its snow-white sands of the Dragon Bay, transparent waters of the Dadong Sea, fluffy palms of Sanya Bay. It's a genuine eastern version of Hawaii. Perfect ecological environment, a scenic coral reef, \"Typhoon Corridor\" that creates ideal waves for surfing, and the sun all year round make this island a perfect resort.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tibet</h3><p>Have you found yourself among multilayered landscapes, peace, a mystical atmosphere, and Buddhist sacred songs? It seems that you have come to Tibet. The richness of this autonomous region hides in the snow cap of the holy Mount Kailash, white-stone walls of the Potala Palace, glass waters of Yamdrok Lake, high-mountain temples, and palaces of Dalai Lamas. Tibet does not look like the rest of China. And this is another proof of how one country can be so diverse and unpredictable.</p>"

During the day, Kuala Lumpur is buried in greenery and exotic flowers, at night, it turns into a neon firefly. In the labyrinths of road junctions, the Petronas Twin Towers serve as a kind of landmark. The ancient temples and colonial houses are mixed up beneath the skyscrapers.\n        Here, you never know what awaits you around the corner: a modern house made of concrete and glass or the gate tower of one of the Hindu temples, let's say \u2014 Sri Mahamariamman Temple, decorated with 230 colorful figures of deities.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Malacca</h3><p>Malacca is a no less important city in Malaysia. It is a UNESCO-protected nature reserve city and is out of the question of demolishing buildings. Malacca is a living monument to multiculturalism. The Portuguese fortress A'Famosa, the Taoist Cheng Hoon Teng Temple and the Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple, the Christian Church of St. Paul and the Sultan's Palace are situated peacefully in its streets.&nbsp;</p><h3>George Town</h3><p>George Town is the central city on the island of Penang. It attracts tourists with its unique cyberpunk character. The main streets (Cannon Street, Armenian Street, Queen Street) are painted with bright graffiti until the rooftops. Modern hypermarkets have been built over, the protected from demolition, wooden houses, and all this cocktail is enriched by the religious temples of Khoo Kongsi, Snake, Eternal Bliss, and Ten Thousand Buddhas.</p><p>Malaysia's main treasures are outside the big cities. They are hidden in galactic accumulations of fluorescent plankton on the banks of the Sungai Sedili Besar, on the Turtle Islands of Sabah, on the growing Mountain Kinabalu, in limestone Mulu Caves, in the tunnel of fireflies over the Kampung Kuantan River, in Batu Caves, Malay jungle and dozens of marine and forest reserves scattered throughout the country.</p><h3>Beaches</h3><p>The beaches of Malaysia make a separate story about this tropical paradise. Snow-white sand blinds your eyes, palm trees gently rustle, and the azure sea merges with the sky on the horizon. Most tourists prefer to stay on the islands of Langkawi and Penang, known not only for its chic beaches and fashionable hotels but also for the rampant wildlife.</p><p>The beaches of Tioman Island are known worldwide for their cleanliness and rich water area. The hand of civilization has not reached this place, and the whole island is a vast protected area. Tengah Beach always welcomes tourists for a relaxing family holiday.</p><h3>Diving</h3><p>The divers are the real fans of Malaysia. They are attracted to the rich underwater world as well as flora and fauna. There is also a favorable climate, which allows you to dive all year round. If you have been dreaming of swimming with whale sharks for a long time, go to Tioman Island. Are you determined to see the world's largest single Mushroom coral? You should go to Redang. You can see World War II shipwrecks off the coast of Labuan. Sipadan Island is a treasure trove of underwater beauty: a lobster lie, coral gardens with cliffs deep in the reef, parrotfishes, rays, sea angels, barracudas, and at least 200 other marine creatures. If you have little diving experience, go practice to the Perhentian Islands. The island's coastline is ideal for snorkeling as you can watch turtles grow in the warm waters of the South China Sea at shallow depths.</p><h3>Surfing</h3><p>Of course, the beaches of Malaysia cannot boast of the awesomeness of the waves with Sri Lanka, but some of the spots are also popular with surfers. From November to April, the wind brings good waves to the east coast. Choose a beach near the villages of Cherating, Desaru, Kerteh, or Kota Bharu for this period. High waves usually go to the coast of Borneo, where brave and experienced surfers ride. Beginners should stop at the beaches of Kemasik, where the sea is relatively calm.</p>"

There is also a large aquarium with sharks and many rare fish.</p><h3>Sharjah</h3><p>Sharjah is suitable for a more peaceful, relaxed family holiday. Here you can lounge on the cleanest beaches on the coast of the Persian Gulf, visit local oriental markets, and have fun in Aljazeera Park. Sharjah is considered to be a kind of cultural capital. The King Faisal Mosque and the ancient Sharjah Heritage Area are some of the main attractions. There are also many museums: ethnographic, artistic, archeological, and historical.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fujairah</h3><p>Fujairah is the best choice for lovers of outdoor activities such as diving and snorkeling. This emirate is located on the shore of the Gulf of Oman with many mountainous capes, mineral springs, natural gorges, and green massifs.

The later is located on an island in the middle of a lake. Access to the building is closed and it is guarded by military forces.\n        The water is teeming with crocodiles.

The city, surrounded by the mountains, is located on the bank of the Mahaweli Ganga River in the very center of the island. That's why it is colder here than on the coast. For centuries, Kandy had been the capital for the kings of Sri Lanka. Some buildings of the old Royal Complex are now open for tourists. One of the last kings, Wickrama Rajasinghe, made it into history as a creator of the artificial lake Bogambara. It later became a real attraction. One of the most prized Buddhist shrines stands on its bank: Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. A few steps from there, you can find a complex of four Hindu temples.

            "en": "<h3>Manama</h3>\n\nManama is the capital of Bahrain and the largest city in the country, with about a quarter of its total population. Here you can feel the influence of British culture quite strongly: the enumeration of the floors is done according to the British system (from the second one), the bars are decorated in the style of Irish pubs, and taxis are exact copies of London cabs. However, the unique flavor of Oriental bazaars has been amazingly preserved here, and the towers of the Bahrain World Trade Centre are harmoniously combined with ancient palaces and mosques.\n        You can wander around the old town for hours, watching the life of its inhabitants, choosing souvenirs and bargaining at colorful markets, or sipping coffee in small cafes. The capital has several key attractions \u2014 King Fahd Causeway (a 25-kilometer-long structure linking Bahrain with Saudi Arabia), several beautiful mosques such as the ancient Al-Khamis, and the XX century Al Fateh (considered to be the largest building in Bahrain). Other notable sites include the Al Fadhel Mosque and St. Christopher's Cathedral, the country's largest fort in Qal'at al-Bahrain, a UNESCO cultural heritage site. Another significant historical monument is the Royal Tombs archaeological complex, which has 85,000 ancient graves. The National Museum of Manama is one of the richest in the Persian Gulf. Its expositions allow getting acquainted with the history and culture of the kingdom. And there is also the Museum of Pearls, Oil and even the Museum of the Quran.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Riffa</h3><p>Riffa is also located on the island of Bahrain, just 7 kilometers from the capital. There are also many interesting sights and places worth visiting. The city itself is divided into two parts \u2014 western and eastern and is growing rapidly. In it, you just have to walk along the shopping streets, choose souvenirs, or even more necessary and useful goods. The most interesting sight in Eastern Riffa is Riffa Fort. It was founded back in the XVII century, and at the beginning of the XIX century, it became the residence of Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa. Nowadays, it is a museum, the entrance to which is free. Even the wind tower, an ancient analog of modern air conditioners, has been preserved here. From Western Riffa, tourists tend to bring selfies in front of the famous Clock Tower. This part of the city is also home to Bahrain's national stadium, where most football battles and other sporting events take place.</p><h3>Muharraq</h3><p>Muharraq was the former capital of Bahrain (until 1923). The city is located on a separate island of the same name, the second-largest after Bahrain. It is adjoined by the artificial Amwaj Islands \u2014 a kingdom of luxury villas, hotels, and even super modern office buildings. As for Muharraq itself, the most interesting places for tourists will be traditional buildings with colorful architecture \u2014 the house of Sheikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa which served as a government residence and the Siyadi House with its refined lines and luxurious interior decoration. There are also two ancient forts that undoubtedly deserve the attention of Bahrain's guests \u2014 Abu Mahir Fort and Arad Fort, which protected the maritime trade routes. They are both undergoing extensive restoration. There is also a real camel farm in the city where race camels are being bred.</p><h3>Sitra</h3><p>Sitra is a small town, which is also located on a separate island of the same name. A thriving industrial center with a port, oil and aluminum processing plants and a desalination company has, in recent years, focused on the development of the tourist industry and has not failed. Comfortable hotels quickly became popular with tourists, as well as fish restaurants. In addition, you can rent a car here and drive around the island. Nature here is impressive, especially the whole groves of date palms, which are irrigated with freshwater springs. Lovers of sea walks and fishing also come here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Barbar</h3><p>Barbar is a tiny town, but more like a village, which, however, deserves the attention of tourists. Here you will find an outstanding architectural monument \u2014 the ancient Barbar Temple. To be more precise, there are even several temples that were built on top of each other, the oldest of which dates back to 3000 BC. Archaeologists believe that they were erected in honor of the god of wisdom and freshwater Enki and his wife, the goddess of fertility Nin\u1e2bursa\u011d. There are two altars in the Barbar Temple and a natural water source, which is of spiritual importance to believers. Unique findings were made during excavations here \u2014 weapons, ceramics, tools, jewelry, and the most resonant of them was the bronze head of a bull.&nbsp;</p><h3>Zallaq</h3><p>Zallaq is another small village, which will be primarily interesting for fans of beach recreation and ecotourism. Its main attraction is the famous Jazaer Beach, with snow-white sand and tender, endless, blue sea. By the way, there is quite a long stretch of shallow water, which is convenient for tourists with children. It is allowed to organize picnics and even set tents right on the beach. Local fishers are quite willing to rent their boats; there is also a yacht club. And nearby, there is one of the national reserves \u2014 Al Areen Wildlife Park. But you need a permit to visit it.</p>"

There are good reasons for this \u2014 Bruneians are exempt from all taxes. Every citizen can get free education not only in the sultanate but also in any country in the world. And relatives will visit the student at public expense. The medical care is also covered, and the family receives a substantial allowance when the child is born. All residents of the country have their own cars (local people prefer expensive brands), so public transport is underdeveloped. All this prosperity was made possible after the discovery of oil deposits in Brunei ( at the beginning of the last century). But the untold wealth of the country has not helped its economy, education, or culture. The industrial products, consumer goods, and even food are imported, and about 40% of all workers are foreigners."

Difficulties are connected with the blurred borders with China and the difference in measurements between Bhutanese and Chinese. Anyway, the height of these mountains is about 7550 meters. In total, there are nineteen seven-thousand-peaks in Bhutan.There are mountain rivers in the country. They have appeared as a result of the melting of glaciers and which occupy 10% of the country's territory. They all form four river systems \u2014 Manas, Sankosh, Wong Chhu, and Shil Torsa \u2014 and carry their waters to neighboring India. The Black Mountains in central Bhutan are a natural watershed. The kingdom also has a mountainous Thorthormi lake and many small reservoirs.The central part of the state is covered with forests, while the southern part is notable for its fertile lands and large-scale jungle, where tigers, leopards, and even elephants live.Bhutan is divided into four dzongdeys (Western, Central, Southern, Eastern), which include 20 dzongkhags.

It was built in 1216 as a Buddhist monastery, where 2000 monks lived. In the middle of the last century, the temple was rebuilt after a fire, and it hosted the government and the King's office. Another attraction is the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu. It is an important religious site not only for the capital but for the whole country. It was erected in 1974 to commemorate the third king of Bhutan.\n        Chorten is made in Tibetan style, in the form of a classic stupa with an altar. Traditionally, to fulfill all the wishes, you have to go around the stupa in a clockwise direction, not forgetting to spin the prayer wheels.\n\n<h3>Phuentsholing</h3><p>It is the second-largest city of Bhutan, on the border with India through which runs the only highway in the state connecting the two countries. The majority of the population in Phuentsholing is Indian. This is where the first post office in the country was opened. Unlike other cities, it has more modern architecture, without monasteries or dzongs. Phuentsholing is famous for its Amo Chhu Crocodile Breeding Centre. Indeed, they are not grown for commercial purposes but to preserve the population of these reptiles. They release the grown specimens from the center to the wild.</p><h3>Paro</h3><p>This is the only town in Bhutan with an international airport that is one of the most inaccessible in the world. Paro is a major religious and cultural center of the kingdom. The main Buddhist shrine of Bhutan is the high-mountain monastery of the Tiger's Nest or Paro Taktsang. It is located at an altitude of 3000 meters, on a steep slope, and consists of seven temples and monastic huts. It can be reached only on foot, or by horse up to half of the way, and then still climb on your own. The Tiger's Nest was destroyed by a fire in 1998 and restored only in 2005. This temple is one of the few monasteries open to visitors.</p><h3>Punakha</h3><p>The old winter capital, which is located in the Wangdue valley. The city has a mild climate, with subtropical plants such as bananas, oranges, and cacti. This is why it is the winter residence of the head of Bhutanese Buddhism, the Je Khenpo. The city has its own monastery \u2014 the Punakha Dzong. It stands at the confluence of two mountain rivers \u2014 Mo Chhu and Pho Chhu. There is a pedestrian bridge across the Mo Chhu River, which meets tourists at the entrance to the temple. In the Punakha Dzong, there is a large bodhi tree, a traditional Tibetan stupa, a library with 108 volumes of Kangyur (a Tibetan canon written in gold letters), and the mausoleum of the founder of the Kingdom of Bhutan.</p><h3>Jakar</h3><p>This is another large religious center with an ancient temple built in the VII century, the Jambey Lhakhang. Legend has it that King Songtsen Gampo ordered 108 monasteries to be built in one day to nail all parts of the demon's body that covered Tibet and the Himalayas, thereby preventing the spread of Buddhism. Kurjey Lhakhang monastery, with the body imprint of the famous guru Padmasambhava, is also worth a visit. This complex consists of three small royal monasteries and a large chorten.</p>"

One of the country's symbols is a 27-meter statue of Jesus Christ, presented by the Indonesians. There is a beautiful view of the coast and Dili near it. In autumn in East Timor, you can observe the migration of dolphins and whales. It is worth mentioning diving off the coast, where you can find sharks and barracuda in addition to the usual corals.

It is a symbiosis of ancient culture, modern technology, socialism, traditions of East and West. After walking in the foggy garden near the pagodas of the Confucian Temple of Literature, you will suddenly find yourself at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. The glass skyscrapers on Trang Thi Avenue blind your eyes! And if you are looking for some serenity, you can find it at Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. People pray and meditate at the Temple of the Jade Mountain, and in the bustling streets of the Old Quarter, which smells of fried delicacies and dust, they have breakfast, cut hair, and sell everything. All this makes Hanoi something particularly charming. However, for most tourists, the capital becomes just a starting point for a trip to North Vietnam.</p><p>H\u1ea1 Long Bay, the most famous tourist attraction in Vietnam, is located a hundred kilometers from Hanoi. It is a place of 3000 small islands, which, like the dragon skin, scattered on the water surface of the South China Sea. Spare no expense on tour! Swim under the stone vaults of karst rocks on kayaks, admire high green mountains and marble cliff slopes from the water, look into cold caves and spend one of the most unforgettable sunsets on the ship's deck.</p><h3>Central Vietnam</h3><p>The sandy beaches of Central Vietnam have become a favorite destination for tourists from all over the world. The main city in the region is Da Nang, a major port and industrial center of the country. The wide sandy beach of China Beach in Da Nang attracts thousands of kite surfers and windsurfers every year, which turns the coast into a kaleidoscope of bright sails and boards.&nbsp;</p><p>Nha Trang is especially popular with tourists. The strip of its snow-white sandy beaches, warm sea, cold cocktails, which are poured in bars of fashionable hotels, encourage enjoying lazy holidays. Divers will love it here: there is a famous Moray Beach, a coral reef called \"Rainbow\", and many picturesque islands near the resort.&nbsp;</p><p>A trip to Central Vietnam will also delight history lovers. We highly recommend H\u1ed9i An for visiting. It is fully protected by UNESCO, as a model of an ancient trade and port city, and Hu\u1ebf, the capital of the last emperors of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. And do not ignore the Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park, which has the largest cave in the world.</p><h3>South Vietnam</h3><p>The heart of the whole country, Ho Chi Minh City, is beating in the south of Vietnam. It is the largest business center and an important transportation hub of the country. The ancient Saigon has preserved its history and colonial spirit within the walls of the Reunification Palace and Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon. From Ho Chi Minh City, a maze of underground labyrinths stretches across the C\u1ee7 Chi district, where Vietnamese hid from Americans during the war.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking for a resort that's ideal for a vacation with a child, head to Phan Thi\u1ebft. The city's 40-meter-long beachfront features a gentle entrance to the sea, shallow coastline, and no corals, rocks, or moray. Other attractions include the Crocodile Nursery, where you can feed reptiles, and the Van Thuy Tu Communal House, where the skeleton fragments of the world's largest mammal are kept. If you are looking for a more active holiday, choose the Mui Ne Peninsula. The east coast of an ancient fishing village has become the center of kiting and surfing in South Vietnam.</p><p>The island of Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c is a genuine pearl of South Vietnam. This paradise is simply designed for a measured rest: the white sandy beaches of Bai Sao, the meditative rustling of palm trees bent over the coast of Ong Lang, the even reel of azure waves and thick green jungle are waiting for the tourists here. But don't worry if you get bored. The Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c's tourist infrastructure is developing at a frantic pace, with bars, casinos, diving schools, luxury hotels, and even an international airport.</p>"

The landmarks of the city include the Church of St. John (1115 A.D.), the Crusader Fortress (dating back to the Phoenician era), the Roman Theatre (218 A.D.), where graves of Phoenician kings were found, and a mosaic depicting Bacchus god. You cannot miss the Temple of Baalat Gebal, the Temple of the Obelisks, and the Well of the God, where Isis mourned Osiris. There is the Archaeological Park in the city, where you can walk among the stones of the ancient city, which \"saw\" the biblical prophets.</p><h3>\u1e62\u016br</h3><p>\u1e62\u016br (also known as Tyre) is the fourth-largest city in Lebanon and the oldest shopping center in Phoenicia and the Mediterranean. It went down in history as the city which had the most prolonged siege. The troops of Alexander the Great had been standing under the walls of Tyre for seven months. It was the only city that did not want to obey the king. It is better to move around \u1e62\u016br on foot as the main locations are close to each other. The Roman Hippodrome or Al Bass Archaeological Complex is the leading tourist destination. There is the Necropolis on its territory, the oldest burial place where human remains are still being found. Some sarcophagi, a monumental arch, an aqueduct, and a Roman road have also been preserved here. The hot springs are a vivid example of Roman architecture. It is better to visit them during sunrise or sunset. A small town of Qana is situated not far from Tyre: it was here where Jesus had turned water into wine. The rock drawings of the first Christians were discovered in caves a couple of kilometers from Qana. Since then, the cave itself has been considered one of the holy places on Earth.&nbsp;</p><h3>Baalbek</h3><p>Baalbek is one of the oldest cities in Lebanon, located near Beirut. This place is famous for its ancient temples, which are impressive in their colossal size and can be rightfully called a \"wonder of the world\". The Baalbek temple complex is the primary and central attraction. It has seen many civilizations! But initially, the temple belonged to the Phoenicians, as they had built an incredibly large stone terrace. The building itself was dedicated to the sun god Baal. Afterward, the city was taken over by the Ancient Greeks, and the place was named Heliopolis, after the sun god Helios. When the Romans came, they called it the Temple of Jupiter, and then the building passed into the hands of the Crusaders, Turks, and Arabs. Nowadays, there are only six columns left of the temple of Jupiter. But even touching one of them can take you back to several thousand years. Today, the Baalbek temple is a masterpiece of ancient Roman architecture, and can only be compared with the Egyptian pyramids by its greatness.</p><h3>Sidon</h3><p>Sidon is one of the oldest cities in Phoenician and the third-largest city in Lebanon, which is also famous for its ancient buildings that have survived to this day. The place has been inhabited since ancient times: archaeological digs discovered artifacts from the Acheulean culture and the early Palaeolithic period. Sidon became the largest center of the ancient world in the XX century B.C. Even Homer wrote many times in his texts about the masters of the area who had created embroidery and glass. Interesting sights are preserved here: the Sidon's Sea Castle, the Phoenician temple complex of the 6th century B.C., the Temple of Eshmun. The pedestal for sacrifice and capitals, which are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, are also remarkable. One can also find one of the oldest synagogues in the world in this city.&nbsp;</p><h3>Jounieh</h3><p>Jounieh is a resort city on the Mediterranean coast, which can pleasantly surprise not only with its high-class beach recreation but also with its diversity of attractions. A cableway to Harissa Hill is one of them. It leads to the bronze statue of Our Lady of Lebanon. There are various monasteries and temples around the statue. Considering that it is a resort town, a casino with an area of 34 000 square meters is one of the attractions. The casino was opened in 1957 and is one of the largest gambling establishments in Lebanon. Hunters of antiquities can go to the Jeita Grotto. Their appearance dates back to the Paleolithic era. Throughout the existence of the caves, nature has managed to create bizarre forms and fascinating stalactites. There are also many springs and the Dog River inside. Tourists who want to get a better overview of history can go to the ethnographic museum. It tells about the reign of eight eras in Lebanon.</p>"

The capital is located on the south coast of North Mal\u00e9 atoll, which is part of another atoll - Kaafu. The Maldivians themselves lacked space in the small capital, so they created a new island, Hulhumale, which they began settling in 2004. There are not so many beaches or paradise landscapes in Mal\u00e9, but it is worth taking a stroll through its streets. The attractions include the National Museum, the Presidential Palace, the court building, Friday Mosque, and many other exciting places of worship and tombs, as well as the central square, the waterfront, and city parks.

The island is home to giant turtles, whose numbers are, unfortunately, declining every year.</p><h3>Meedhiffushi</h3><p>Meedhiffushi is a part of the Maldives that is just starting to host travelers.

The Great Himalayan Range covers almost the entire area from the north, making Nepal the highest mountainous country in the world. Eight of the world's fourteen highest mountain peaks, the so-called \"eight thousandths\", are in Nepal, including Mount Everest. However, 20% of all of Nepal's land is covered with national parks and sanctuaries. The climate of the country, without exaggeration, is unique \u2014 from tropical and subtropical to freezing and lifeless ice zone, which starts at 5 thousand 200 meters above sea level.In Nepal, bamboo, and cedars, snow leopards and rhinoceroses live together on a rather small territory. There are also tropical jungle and alpine meadows.Nepal is not rich in mineral resources and has no access to the sea.Today, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. The Kathmandu Valley, the life center of Nepal, is located between the Great Himalayas and the Mahabharata Range. It is home to three of the country's oldest cities, including its capital.Administratively, Nepal is divided into seven provinces, which in turn consist of 77 districts.

            "en": "<h3>Kathmandu</h3>\n\nKathmandu is the capital of this mountainous region and one of the unique cities in the world. It was included in the list of Seven World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Majestic temples erected hundreds or even thousands of years ago, palaces, squares, and labyrinths of narrow streets that can capture the imagination of a traveler both with their grandeur and poverty \u2014 all this is waiting for travelers in Kathmandu. You should definitely take a walk in Durbar Square.\n        At least fifty temple structures and palaces are concentrated there, the walls of which remind of coronations of monarchs, wars, epidemics, and devastating earthquakes. Climb to Swayambhu or the Temple of the Monkeys to see the largest stupa of a temple with Buddha's Eye. It is believed to be about 2,000 years old. You should definitely visit the sanctuary of Shiva, the Pashupatinath Temple, one of the main Hindu sanctuaries in the country. The cremations made it world-famous, as the dead are burned here right in the open air. Visit the Buddhist temple complex Boudhanath, which has long been the center of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal. In this city, you come across something ancient and unique at almost every step, something that still inhabits the spirit of that very ancient Nepal.\n\n<h3>Bhaktapur</h3><p>Bhaktapur is another ancient city located in the Kathmandu Valley, 16 kilometers from the capital. Its name translates as \"city of believers\" and, indeed, it has almost two hundred temples and a huge number of Hindu religious monuments. One of the main Hindu gods Vishnu, is especially honored here, and more than a dozen local temples and many other religious buildings are dedicated to him. This city was once the capital of the Malla Kingdom. It was at this time that unique palaces and religious buildings appeared here, which today have become the main tourist attractions. Just like in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur's central palace square is surrounded by temples, pagodas, and palaces. They include the Royal Dynasty Palace of Malla, decorated with marvelous wood carvings. Particular attention should be paid to the Lions' Gate and the Golden Gate. Bhaktapur is also called the city of potters and craftsmen. It is their products, which are sometimes sold right on the ground by the workshops. They can become beautiful souvenirs reminding you of your journey.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lalitpur</h3><p>Lalitpur (\"The City of Beauty\" or Patan) is rightly considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in Nepal. In it, as in many other cities of the country, the central square of Durbar is a collection of the most exciting sights. First of all, it is a former royal palace, the roof of which, along the perimeter, is guarded continuously by dozens of wooden heroes and deities, painted in bright colors. Next to it, there is the stone temple of Krishna Mandir, with magnificent carvings depicting scenes from \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\". The terracotta temple of Thousand Buddhas, four stupas of King Ashoka, and the only zoo in Nepal \u2014 Jawalakhel \u2014 these places undoubtedly deserve the attention of tourists. Patan is really very beautiful as it has long been a city of artists, architects, and jewelers who have always decorated it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pokhara</h3><p>Pokhara is the third most populous city in the country. First of all, it attracts tourists not by architectural and cult masterpieces, but by the magnificent nature. Situated on the shore of Phewa Lake, it delights its guest with its stunning Himalayan landscapes. It is from Pokhara that most of the mountain routes start. Nearby, there are several \"eight thousandths\" and the only mountain museum in the world. Not far from the city, there is a unique Mahendra Cave, which is home to a real army of bats. There is also a huge bazaar in Pokhara that stretches for 7 kilometers. As the locals state, you can find anything you want at this bazaar. However, there are also cult buildings here. It is the most beautiful Buddhist Peace Pagoda, located on one of the hills, Tal Barahi Temple, situated on an island in the middle of Phewa Lake and Dakshinkali Temple near Pokhara. By the way, locals come here twice a week with bloody gifts \u2014 sacrificial chickens, sheep, or goats for six-armed Kali, wife of Shiva.</p><h3>Lumbini</h3><p>Lumbini (Sanskrit for \"favorite\"), located 12 kilometers from the border with India, is considered to be a place of worship for every Buddhist. This is where Gautama Buddha, the founder of this religion, was born. In 1896, archeologists discovered a stone column with inscriptions of King Ashoka notifying about the birth of Buddha in this area. Nowadays, it is a place of pilgrimage and great interest to tourists from different countries. Next to it, there is Maya Devi Temple with a bas-relief depicting the birth of Buddha and the Puskarni pond, where his mother performed the ceremony of ablution. Every country with the Buddhist faith can build a temple in Lumbini. Cambodia, Thailand, China, and even Germany have already done that. It is in this city that they sell a unique souvenir, which is almost never seen in other regions of the country \u2014 a statue of a Buddha baby.</p><h3>Janakpur</h3><p>Janakpur is a city that used to be called Mithila, a former center of Maithil culture that had its own language and script. Mention of this city is made in the text of the Ramayana, which states that Ram's wife, Sita, was from these regions. According to legends, the king Janaka found Sita in the field as a baby, raised her as his own daughter, and promised to give her as a wife only to the one who could bend the sacred bow of Shiva. Rama did not just bend it, but broke it and took the girl as his wife. It seems that you travel in time when the city celebrates holidays dedicated to Rama. Janakpur is a pilgrimage site for Hindus from all over the world. It's also believed to have been home to the Buddha and Mahavira for some time. By the way, Janakpur is one of the few regions in Nepal that has a railroad.</p>"

Come here to walk along the waterfront or take a ride on one of the many cycling routes, take a picture on the \"Lovers' Bridge\", taste street Taiwanese fast food, or try Turkish ice cream.</p><h3>Kenting National Park</h3><p>Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan is one of the oldest on the island. More than 300 km\u00b2 of emerald forests, sandy beaches and waterfalls, and coral reefs have made Kenting National Park famous.</p><h3>Taroko Gorge</h3><p>The Taroko Gorge is considered to be one of the most picturesque places on the island.

The Uzbeks had been building houses for years, developing trade and agriculture. Life was always in full swing here, and all thanks to the advantageous geographical location of Uzbekistan \u2014 almost in the center of the Great Silk Road. In ancient times, endless caravans of camels with goods from Asia to Europe and back walked through its territory across vast deserts. Today, tourists come here to taste lamb pilaf, manti, and chorba, to buy real works of art at the local market \u2014 painted earthenware, leather bags, and colored carpets, and just feel the spirit of the east against the background of spectacular nature."

            "en": "<p>Many cities in Uzbekistan began to exist even before our era. Of course, the buildings of that time didn't survive till our days. But it is quite real to see the architecture of XIII-XIV centuries here.</p><h3>Tashkent</h3><p>Tashkent (translated from Uzbek as a \"stone city\") is the capital of Uzbekistan and the largest city in the country. As life in the East is bustling around bazaars, the Chorsu Market is a must-visit for tourists in Tashkent. It has been thriving since the Middle Ages and allows you to dive into the atmosphere of the oriental world truly. On its counters, one can see huge watermelons, melons with captivating aroma, red-ripe tomatoes, deep-green herbs, colorful fabrics, carpets, and incredibly beautiful painted dishes. The Botanical Garden holds a leading position among the most visited places in Tashkent. Thanks to its mild climate, it is open to visitors all year round. Its territory is divided into five zones, each of them modeling natural complexes of East and Central Asia, North America, Europe, and the Far East. The best way to get around the city is by subway. Not only because it is a fast and comfortable option, but also because the Tashkent subway is magnificent.</p><h3>Bukhara</h3><p>Another major city in Uzbekistan is Bukhara, which the Uzbeks themselves call a sacred one. An old belief says: \"On all Muslim cities a gracious light descends from heaven, and over Bukhara, it rises to heaven\". This is because there is an incredible number of mosques and tombs of Islamic saints. The old part of the city, where more than 170 monuments of architecture and history are concentrated, deserves special attention. Walk around Lyab-i Hauz Square, visit Kalan Mosque, medieval baths, admire the beauty of Nadir Divan-Begi Madrasah, and stay here for dinner. Bukhara gives a sense of a fairy tale \u2014 everything here is magical and beautiful.</p><h3>Samarkand</h3><p>Samarkand is the third-largest city in Uzbekistan and one of the oldest on the planet. For more than 2000 years, it has been a central point on the Great Silk Road, connecting China and the Mediterranean countries. Many come here to see with their own eyes the famous Registan, which served as the central square in the Middle Ages. It is an architectural ensemble of three stunning madrasas \u2014 Tilya Kori, Ulugh Beg, and Sherdor. The Bibi-Khanym Mosque and the Shah-i-Zinda Mausoleum complex, which locals call the \"cemetery street\", also deserve tourists' attention. Muslim saints, relatives of the famous Timur ruler, religious figures, thinkers, and philosophers rest in the mausoleum. The complex is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p><h3>Khiva</h3><p>Khiva is a unique city, which has a centuries-old history. It's not easy to get to it. You have to overcome the Kyzylkum desert. It is convenient for tourists because most sights are concentrated in the inner city, Itchan Kala. There are 60 monuments here, dating back to the XVI-XX centuries. The majority of madrasas, mosques, minarets, and palaces of Khiva belong to the epoch of existence of the Khanate of the same name (XVII-XIX centuries). Architects have created unique architectural buildings in the city, so you can enjoy their diversity, leisurely strolling through its narrow streets. The Kalta Minor Minaret, an ancient monument 29 meters high, is a symbol of the city. The building is unfinished, so the local population has created many legends, each of them explaining its incompleteness. Hurry up here for a tour, and you'll learn everything for yourself.</p><h3>Termez</h3><p>Termez is the southernmost city in Uzbekistan. Not far from it is the famous \"Friendship Bridge\", which connects Uzbekistan with Afghanistan. It was used to carry out the withdrawal of troops after the 10-year war. Many tourists come here to pay tribute to the memory of fallen soldiers. This city was repeatedly literally washed off the face of the earth. Therefore, it is worth to start acquaintance with the Archaeological Museum, which was opened in 2002 and collected a huge number of artifacts of different times. It will also be fascinating to see the Buddhist temple complex Fayaz-Tepe ( the I-III centuries BC), to visit the Aral-Paygambar nature reserve and the family burial vault of local sayyids.</p>"

The most important building in Canada - the Parliament - is located here. More than 3 million tourists come here annually to watch a change of guards by Parliament Hill. The National Gallery of Canada with a vast collection of arts and the magnificent Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier castle also deserve tourists\u2019 attention. Ottawa won\u2019t let families with children get bored!\n        The Canadian Children\u2019s Museum and the farm on the territory of the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum work for little travelers. Romantics set their hearts on the central Rideau canal. In summer, they enjoy going boating, and in winter they prefer skating on the frozen surface of the canal holding hands.\n\n<h3>Toronto</h3><p>Progressive Toronto is a so-called Canadian New York. The megapolis does its best to surpass its American opponent. We should say, the city is doing great in this! The glass business district with black towers of the Toronto-Dominion center, bright advertising banners on Yonge Street, futuristic shapes of the CN Tower which offers a fantastic view on the city, cold shadows of the trees in High Park, art exhibits at Harbourfront Centre \u2014 it definitely looks like New York in miniature. However, the city has its raisins on the cupcake! You can see them in the bastions of Fort York, the picturesque castle of the first European colonists Casa Loma, and the Hockey Hall of Fame. But the megalopolises share Niagara Falls for two. And the best views on the most powerful waterfall in North America can be seen from the Canadian side.</p><h3>Vancouver</h3><p>Beautiful Vancouver lives on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in picturesque Burrard Inlet. Thought out to the last detail in regards to the infrastructure, clean and safe, it is rightfully considered to be one of the best cities for living. This city is young and you won\u2019t find here any historical monuments. Among all the attractions, Stanley Park deserves special attention. It is so large, interesting, and diverse, that you should devote a full day to exploring it. In addition to that, find some time to visit the historical center Gastown and Chinatown, Queen Elizabeth Park and VanDusen Botanical Garden with its odd green mazes, and, of course, relax at city beaches. Tolerant and ecological Vancouver will become a perfect starting point to explore the province of British Columbia. It\u2019s a stone's throw away from the old-growth forest of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve and the Great Bear Rainforest. You can also head to the beach to surf or to the Whistler skiing resort. Nothing can stop you from drinking excellent wine in the Okanagan Valley or to go on a safari to the Haida Gwaii archipelago.&nbsp;</p><h3>Montreal</h3><p>If you suddenly feel the unbearable craving for Europe, you should come to Montreal. The bricked streets of Old Montreal will take you to the times of the French colonization. The splendid ornamentation of the halls at Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal, the sharp spires of the Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, ancient mansions and prestigious universities, masonry vaults of Windsor Station that only a hundred years ago accepted immigrants from the whole continent on its platforms \u2014 all of this add coziness and nobility to the typical modern city landscapes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quebec</h3><p>Quebec is the most French city in Canada. It\u2019s the capital of the homonymous province. It grew on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River and saved the unique atmosphere of the port cities of the Old World. Tourists love it for walks along its bricked streets, for the spires of the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac that seems to have just appeared from the screens of the \u201cGrand Budapest Hotel\u201d movie. They love it for the austere vaults of the Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, for the successful symbiosis of modern technologies and Parisian charm. Without exaggeration, Quebec can be called the most musical city in Canada. One festival is hardly over, and they are already getting ready for the next musical fairy show. The winter carnival in the ice castle at Place Jacques-Cartier is replaced by the musical Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 roaring all over the Old Town for 11 days! The heartful festival of jazz and blues gives in its scene to the traditional festival of New France.&nbsp;</p><h3>Alberta</h3><p>Perhaps, only Alberta can beat the beauty of Quebec\u2019s landscapes. Every summer, when the snow starts to melt, the water of Peyto Lake in Banff National Park turns into genuine azure. Bison wander among the dense forests of Wood Buffalo National Park. Beavers construct dams on rivers, and fossils come to Lake Athabasca to drink some water. The rocky mountains of Jasper National Park are so picturesque and unique that they were taken under UNESCO\u2019s protection.&nbsp;</p><h3>Edmonton</h3><p>Edmonton is the capital of Alberta. The city might seem to be slightly mediocre after traveling through the province. But don\u2019t underestimate it. Displays of the Royal Alberta Museum, World of Science Center impress even the most sophisticated travelers. And more than 40 festivals that take place in the city throughout a year won\u2019t even give a single chance of getting bored. The extravagant Fringe Theatre Festival, authentic Edmonton Folk Music or heartful Symphony Under the Sky \u2014 choose an even to your liking and come for a visit.</p>"

The Aztecs founded it back in the 14th century. Nowadays, it has grown to the size of the city with 20 million people! So, consider renting a hotel or an apartment in the center of the town and take at least five days to explore the capital.\n        We recommend listening to the mariachi in Plaza Garibaldi; take a boat ride on the canals of Xochimilco and see the creepy Doll Island; see the Aztec pyramids in Teotihuac\u00e1n; check out the frescoes of Diego Rivera in the Palacio Nacional and the vaults of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral; visit the House of Frida Kahlo \u2014 an artist and famous feminist; and enjoy views of the city from Chapultepec Castle.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Guadalajara</h3><p>Guadalajara is home to everything Mexican. Explore the Old Centre, walk along the gorgeous Baroque buildings of the colonial era, intertwined with images of conquistador times. In these streets, centuries ago, folk tunes of Spanish Andalusia and American Indian songs merged into the mariachi \u2014 Mexican national music. Life here goes slower than in the rest of Mexico, but it's easier to breathe thanks to the abundance of parks and gardens. Once, the craftsmen from Guadalajara invented sombreros and tequila, and today the city is called the \"Mexican Silicon Valley\". Here, people honor traditions and keep up with the progressive world. Guadalajara is ready to amaze and delight you, so don't hesitate to include this city in your list of must-visit places.</p><h3>Cancun</h3><p>Cancun is the most popular Mexican resort.

But if this type of holiday is not for you, and you have already booked accommodation in Cancun, do not worry. From here, you can take one-day trips to one of the Seven New Wonders of the World \u2014 the pyramids of Kukulkan, in the ancient city of Chichen Itza.

It has no direct access to the sea, so only numerous museums, gastronomic evenings, bookshops, and an odd number of architectural attractions are available for tourists. The neoclassical Casa Museo Montes Molina, the plantations of Hacienda Sotuta de Pe\u00f3n, the Colonial-era Cathedral, the Church of Iglesia El Jesus, the Merida Theatre, the halls of Nahualli Casa de Los Artistas and dozens of other yellow, blue, pink and white elegant facades \u2014 walks through the streets of the city guarantee an incredible aesthetic pleasure.&nbsp;</p><h3>Oaxaca</h3><p>The ancient Mayan culture is concentrated in Oaxaca. As a part of your one-day visit, be sure to go see the majestic Church of Santo Domingo de Guzman, where the \"elite\" get married, visit one of the museums of local culture, listen to a concert on Z\u00f3calo Square. Don't forget to taste the mezcal and drink as much hot chocolate that is produced here as you can.</p><h3>Acapulco</h3><p>In the 50s, the resort with the sonorous name Acapulco was especially popular among the American film elite. Nowadays, Acapulco is open to everyone who wants to relax on the Pacific coast. Luxurious and standard hotels, wide sandy beaches, expensive restaurants, and affordable cafes, cozy picturesque bays, and mind-blowing nightlife \u2014 each guest here will find a holiday option fitting his pocket. If you are bored with a measured beach holiday, visit the Chapel of Peace, Papagayo National Park, San Diego's 17th-century fortress, La Quebrada Cliffs Bay, and Isla de la Roqueta, where nature has created fantastic conditions for diving.</p>"

The city looks pompous and is in marked contrast to any other megalopolis in the USA. Unlike New York, it doesn\u2019t have a single skyscraper. At the same time, the Big Apple is a city of opportunities and making the American dream come true. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to go jogging into Central Park and stroll under the neon signs at Times Square? Drink a cup of coffee on the Brooklyn Bridge and ascend the Statue of Liberty; shake the forepaw of the T-Rex at the American Museum of Natural History or listen to some jazz in Greenwich Village. We are all familiar with all of these owing to the diversity of movies and songs devoted to this megapolis.</p><h3>The North</h3><p>In the north, the enormous horseshoe of Niagara Falls united Canada and America. It\u2019s neither the highers nor the widest waterfall in the world. However, the power of this water flow falling down with great force from the cliff is truly impressive.</p><p>The specialists for the stock exchanges in New York and governers of the Capitol study on the east coast. Harvard, Yale, Brown, Princeton, Cornell \u2014 all these names traditionally associate with prestige and high quality of education. Every year, the universities of the Ivy League offer scholarships for education. So, anyone can enter the society of the young American elite, even you.</p><h3>Florida</h3><p>The seriousness of the north-eastern region can be easily dispelled with a trip to the south. Here, in the state of Florida, you can watch, gasped, the launch of the rockets, spend the whole day having fun at Legoland and Walt Disney World, relax on snow-white sandy beaches, and search for the rare species of a cougar in the mangroves of Everglades National Park.</p><p>If you can smell a sharp odor of the hydrogen sulfide, you have probably arrived at Yellowstone National Park. Hot springs, painted with dozens of bacteria; geysers that are more than 2000 meters in height; sky-blue lakes - the picture is mind-blowing! In addition to everything, all this water around you is boiling and bubbling, getting warmed up from the active supervolcano.</p><h3>The West</h3><p>Let\u2019s go further to the west. Here, the red rocks more than two kilometers in height and bitten by a wild river meet you. You stand on the top and can\u2019t decide won\u2019t deeper: the blue sky with the cry of the falcon, or Grand Canyon which echo reflects the original song of the feathered hunter.</p><h3>California</h3><p>Passing by the stone canyon, moving through the forests and waterfalls of Yosemite National Park, you find yourself in California. Sunny Los Angeles will meet you with the landscapes of Beverly Hills and Melrose districts. They seem to be so familiar after watching those renowned series in the 90s. One a year in Hollywood, the worldwide known movie stars tremble with excitement and get jitters on the red carpet aspiring to get the Oscars. Long Beach and Santa Monica are never tired to please their visitors with golden beaches, fluffy palm trees, and perfect waves for surfing. When the tan has firmly stuck to your skin, head to get more impressions at Universal Park and Disneyland. Believe us, these places entertain and amaze not only children!</p><h3>Places You Can\u2019t Miss</h3><p>When you travel across the US, there are several places you can\u2019t miss. Don\u2019t forget to add Millennium Park in Chicago, the mountain lakes in the suburbs of Seattle, the city of sin and depravity Las Vegas, and, of course, Hawaii, the island of songs to ukulele, and silk velvet sunsets to your route. In general, just improvise! No matter what direction you choose, you will always find something interesting and incredible!</p>"

The total area of the Bahamas is 13,940 km\u00b2 while the area of inhabited islands is 11,400 km\u00b2. Administratively, the State is divided into districts. At the moment, there are 31 of them, and each has its own self-government bodies. The island of New Providence, where the capital of the Bahamas (Nassau) is located, is under direct government control.The coast of the archipelago is washed by the warm current of the Gulf Stream. With its closest continental neighbor, the peninsula of Florida (USA), which is only 90 km away, it is separated by the strait of the same name. The Old Bahamas Channel separates it from the island of Cuba.The relief of the islands is mainly flat. The highest point of the archipelago is Mount Alvernia (63 m) on Cat Island. There are almost no rivers in the Bahamas, which causes certain difficulties with fresh water. The west coast of the islands is torn with salt lagoons, and there are also many mangrove swamps. The eastern islands are arider. They are covered with savannas and thickets of thorny evergreen bushes. Some of the islands have preserved tropical forests."

            "en": "<h3>Nassau</h3>\n\nThe capital city of Nassau is located on the small island of New Providence. And it has literally everything that a traveler can dream of. Its architecture is an unforgettable mixture of buildings of XVIII-XIX centuries and ultramodern constructions. The most unusual museum of the capital is stylized as a pirate ship and is fully dedicated to these sea bandits. In 1706, they founded a quasi-state - the Republic of Pirates on the islands.\n        The Paradise island, connected to the city with a bridge, has everything for a variety of recreation \u2014 casinos, luxury hotels, golf fields, a dolphinarium, and a water park. Nassau beaches offer white silk sand, turquoise water, and picturesque reefs. People here can go yachting and water skiing, diving, snorkeling, and sport fishing. And you can admire a diverse sea life in the Crystal Cay Marine Park Aquarium. Lovers of exclusive shopping should definitely visit Bay Street and the Straw Market. The Queen's Staircase is the most visited attraction. Its 65 steps are carved into the rock, the top of which offers a beautiful view of the city. The Royal Victoria Garden and Ardastra Gardens, Zoo and Conservation Centre (a nature reserve in the heart of the town) are tourists' favorite green areas.\n\n<h3>Freeport</h3><p>Freeport is a resort city on the island of Grand Bahama. Mangrove swamps and rainforests surround it. Its parks and gardens are full of bougainvillea, orchids, and jasmine. Freeport never sleeps. Beaches are an absolute priority for daytime entertainment.

Gold Rock is the most beautiful wild beach in Lucayan National Park, an ideal place for photoshoots. Lovers of active recreation will appreciate the golf fields, tennis courts, and sea fishing centers. A trip to the perfume factory Fragrance of the Bahamas is one of the most exciting excursion programs of the resort. Here you can create your own fragrance and get it as a souvenir. A favorite gastronomic attraction of tourists is the restaurant Le Chicken Snack, which serves the perfect chicken barbecue. Both local and guests go to \"Lucayan Market\" for shopping. As the sun goes down, nightclubs, bars, and discos with foam parties, cocktails, and live music come into play. You can try your luck and tickle your nerves in one of the Freeport casinos.</p><h3>Marsh Harbour</h3><p>Marsh Harbour is situated on the island of Great Abaco. It is the third-largest city in the country and an important tourist center. It is also known as the world's sailing capital. Hundreds of beautiful yachts and boats are moored on its shores. Many of them can be rented to go searching for deserted beaches or to travel the vast Atlantic Ocean. There are chic villas, hotels, and guest houses built near the water's edge. The beaches are covered with pure white sand, and the coral reefs off the coast are the best place to dive. Walker Cay Reef, the main center of sport fishing in the Bahamas, is one of them. Don McKay Boulevard has the highest concentration of the best cafes and duty-free shops. The most popular restaurant in the city, Native Pork Roast, is waiting for the real fans of gastronomic experiments. The exotic yellow building of the Seaview Castle is the main historical attraction of Marsh Harbour. It is a mansion built by the American Evan Cottman, who was in love with this city. The lighthouse of the same name is located in the village of Hope Town, very close to the center. Tourists love taking pictures of this bright red-and-white building. And when you take the 101 steps to the observation deck, you can enjoy the marvelous views of the surrounding area. Tilloo Cay National Reserve is located near the coast. Many people come here to watch seabirds.</p><h3>Matthew Town</h3><p>Matthew Town is the only inhabited area on Great Inagua Island, the southernmost point of the Bahamas. The city was founded in the middle of the XIX century. Its streets have well-preserved buildings of the classical colonial architecture of that period. The Great Inagua Lighthouse is the main historical attraction. This elegant white building on Mortimer Hill not only performs its direct functions but also serves as an excellent observation platform. On a clear day, you can even see Cuba from here. Before the appearance of the lighthouse, at the beginning of the XIX century, many ships crashed on the rocky shores and reefs of the island. Moreover, it was often raided by pirates. The legend that there are Spanish galleons that had sunk in the XVI-XVIII centuries and rich English and French vessels, which are hiding near Matthew Town, still stirs up the minds of treasure hunters. Lovers of diving, snorkeling, and sea fishing appreciate their leisure time in this city. But it is even more attractive for eco-tourists. There is a large bird sanctuary in the center of the island. More than 80 thousand exotic birds \u2014 flamingos, roseate spoonbill, Bahama pintail, pelicans, white and gray herons \u2014 live here.

Here, among other things, you can see whole herds of wild goats and donkeys.</p><h3>Alice Town</h3><p>Alice Town is the capital of a group of Bimini islands that Ernest Hemingway adored. It's the most famous sea fishing center. It attracts visitors from all over the world to find wahoo, tuna, shortfin mako shark, barracuda, garfish, or blue marlin. The city provides its guests with comfortable marinas, hotels, and guest houses. There are a lot of fishing clubs, but the most famous of them is at the Compleat Angler Hotel. It's where Hemingway wrote his novel \"To Have and Have Not\". The club has a collection of rare photos of the author and his personal memorabilia. Alice Town Beach is an uninterrupted fine sand line, but the locals divide it into Radio Beach and Blister Bay. The first one boasts of plenty of bars and fast-food restaurants, while the second has more privacy. The city also has an architectural highlight, the Dolphin House Museum. It is a concrete building on a handmade steel frame. It is decorated with many panels and mosaics of tiles, stones, shells, beach glass, and other items found on the coast. Near Alice Town, in the ocean, lie two natural or human-made (scientists are still arguing) stone formations \u2014 the Bimini Road and the Wall of Bimini. Many even believe that these are the ruins of Atlantis. You have to scuba dive to see them with your own eyes.</p>"

One can easily explore Belmopan in one day. But you won't have time for boredom, because there are many exciting places in the Belmopan neighborhood. For example, Guanacaste National Park, where the trees of the same name grow.\n        They make canoes out of epiphytes, the yields of guanacaste. Or St. Herman's Blue Hole National Park, where the flow of the Sibun River goes into the underground caves in some places. One of them contains a unique karst lake, after which the whole park is named. The St. Hermann's Caves, a famous site for the sacrificial ceremonies of the ancient Mayan people, will not disappoint you either.\n\n<h3>Belize City</h3><p>Belize City is a picturesque city founded back in the XVIII century by English settlers. Let its name not surprise you because this town used to be the capital of the state. But tropical storms forced the authorities to move the capital inland, leaving Belize City as the largest port and economic center of the country. Tourists will not be bored here. The city is famous for its museums, the main of which (Museum of Belize) is located in the building of the former colonial prison of the middle of the XVIII century. There are also interesting expositions in the Maritime Museum, Coastal Zone Museum, National Handicraft Centre, and the Maya Center Mayan Museum.

Punta Gorda is of more value to locals rather than tourists, as it is a large agricultural center and an important customs point. The city is quite dull, and you can easily explore it in an hour and a half. But there is something to see in its surroundings: Port Honduras Marine Reserve, where you can see clumsy manatees and thousands of other sea creatures; Snake Cayes Reef, which represents the southern end of the Barrier Reef and attracts divers with its underwater scenery; the small Mayan city of Nim Li Punit, famous for its steles and royal graves with records of ancient people.</p><h3>Placencia</h3><p>Placencia is a small resort town in the county of Stann Creek, in the extreme south of the country. It is a truly heavenly place, a green oasis in the middle of the blue ocean. Placencia is chosen for its spectacular sandy beaches and enchanting date with nature. Be sure to visit the jaguars at the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, the tiger sharks at Gladden Spit and Silk Cayes Marine Reserve, and dive by the Barrier Reef, the longest coral reef in the Western Hemisphere. And try to see fantastic manatees in the picturesque lagoons of Placencia at dawn and dusk every day.&nbsp;</p><h3>San Ignacio</h3><p>San Ignacio is located in the west of the country and is the center of Cayo County. Those who prefer hiking and historical sightseeing should definitely come here. San Ignacio is sinking into the greenery of the rainforest of the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve. Here, you can enjoy murmuring mountain rivers and waterfalls, wandering cougars and tapirs, and learn the secrets of Barton Creek and Che Chem Ha Caves. When you have enough of exploring the forest trails, make sure you visit the ruins of Tipu, one of the last Mayan strongholds of resistance to Spanish conquerors.</p>"

However, later on, his words were not confirmed, and no gold was found here. On the other hand, the Spaniards were quite successful in growing coffee, cocoa, and bananas. Today Costa Rica can be rightfully called the most tourist country in Latin America. And its virgin nature, with its stunning biodiversity, is considered to be the main attraction. Forests cover 2/3 of the country's territory, so ecotourism is the main focus of this industry in Costa Rica. About 30 percent of the country's area, which contains more than 70 reserves, is protected by the state.

Between the mountains, there is a huge Central plateau with fertile soils and a variety of flora and fauna. Costa Rica is also full of volcanoes, and some of them active. The country also includes several uninhabited islands, the largest of which is Cocos, known worldwide as \"Treasure Island\". However, more than 300 treasure hunting expeditions could not find a single coin. The real treasure, in fact, is its nature. It is so diverse and unique that the state has made this territory protected. It is possible to visit the island only with a special permit. Recently, its clean and calm waters have attracted more and more diving enthusiasts from all over the world.Costa Rica is divided into seven provinces, which, in turn, consist of the cantons. There are 81 of them in general."

It is located in the heart of the country, where almost all tourist routes start. In San Jose, ancient buildings quite organically adjoin modern constructions made of glass and concrete, creating its own unique style. Both in the city itself and its surroundings, there are many exciting things for visitors: the majestic Cathedral, Parque Nacional Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the museums of gold, jade, and even the university museum of exotic insects.\n        Small markets and streets are filled with a unique atmosphere, and in the surrounding neighborhoods of the city, tourists can find coffee plantations, butterfly farms, and even volcanoes. Annually, on December 15 (or preferably on Saturday, closer to December 15), San Jose hosts an evening carnival \u2014 the \"Festival of Light\".\n\n<h3>Cartago</h3><p>Cartago is a city that managed to save its history. It's also called \"the city of thick fogs\". Once it was the capital and even until now, it is here that you can see the most beautiful ancient buildings and ruins of the colonial era. This city was often affected by earthquakes, which actually destroyed most of the unique constructions. But one of them \u2014 the Basilica of Our Lady of Angels \u2014 survived and is still considered to be the country's main shrine. It is here, where pilgrims from all over the world come to worship the statue of the Black Madonna, which is believed to be the patron saint of Costa Rica. Picturesque mountains surround Cartago, and 30 kilometers from the city, you shall find an active volcano called Irazu.</p><h3>Alajuela</h3><p>Alajuela is the third-largest and one of the most beautiful cities in Costa Rica, that has retained its traditional colonial style. In addition to its stunning architecture, the Po\u00e1s Volcano, with its two craters, is a significant attraction in Alajuela. The smaller one has a tiny lake with cool water. Tourists can walk up to the very mouth of the volcano and even smell the sulfur coming from its depths.</p><h3>Heredia</h3><p>Heredia is the coffee capital of Costa Rica. Coffee plantations are literally all over the region. The precious bean for the fragrant drink is the number one reason why a tourist should come here. Special tours to the plantations allow you to get acquainted with the full process of producing the most popular drink in the world \u2014 from growing coffee trees and harvesting beans to preparing the coffee itself and its tasting. And the ancient fort is the leading local architectural attraction.&nbsp;</p><h3>Puntarenas</h3><p>Puntarenas is the main sea gate of Costa Rica and a paradise for ecotourists. This is where the country's main seaport is located, from where coffee is sent all over the world. Magnificent beaches and lush forest thickets, mangroves where crocodiles swim peacefully, herons, and other exotic birds \u2014 all this natural diversity can be seen in one place. A boat ride around Puntarenas will give you am unforgettable impressions.</p><h3>Liberia</h3><p>Liberia or a \"white city\" as it is called by Costa Ricans, owing to the abundance of white buildings in colonial style. The Spanish culture and traditions such as siesta are presented here like in no other cities in the country. The majestic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is one of the city's main attractions. Liberia is also a starting point for exploring Costa Rica's protected wildlife sanctuaries, mainly the Rincon de la Vieja National Park, with its fabulous waterfalls and picturesque volcanoes.</p><h3>Puerto Lim\u00f3n</h3><p>Puerto Lim\u00f3n is a port city on the east coast. The majority of the population comes from Jamaica, whose ancestors once built a railway to the port to simplify coffee exports to Europe. Therefore, the city bears the imprint of African-Caribbean culture, which is not typical of Costa Rica. Puerto Lemon offers the most convenient access to the Parque Nacional Tortuguero, and its main wonder is the giant leatherback turtles. Cahuita National Park, with its unique beaches, attracts surfers from all over the world. Also, Lim\u00f3n, as the Costa Ricans themselves call it, offers tourists the most beautiful coral reefs. However, it's strictly forbidden to take raw corals out of the country.</p><h3>Quesada</h3><p>Quesada is one of the major cities in the north of the country. It is also a fascinating destination for ecotourists. Here you can watch the bird world in Juan Castro Blanco National Park. Arenal Volcano is located within a one-hour drive from the city. Every April, there is an agricultural exhibition accompanied by a carnival and a horse parade.</p>"

First of all, it is the Old and New Cathedral, the Parliament Building, the National Palace, and the Ruben Dario National Theatre. Walk around Tiscapa Lagoon Natural Reserve, visit the National Arboretum and the Salvador Allende Port. The Juan Paul II Museum opened here a few years ago. The city's marketplace offers bargaining and shopping for fresh products, metal, and wooden handicrafts and jewelry. But it is better to go shopping in the Plaza Inter mall.\n        The active Masaya Volcano (in the National Park of the same name) is 20 km southeast of Managua. It hasn't erupted in a long time, but there are regular volcanic gas emissions. The crater looks impressive, and the view from the observation deck is beautiful. We recommend you visit this amazing creation of nature.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Granada</h3><p>Granada is considered the most touristic city in the country. Unlike the capital, the buildings here have a more \"European look\", and the prices here are higher. The town has a fresh lake, where you can swim by boat, but you should not swim in the water yourself as it is not very clean. Here you can order a tour at the local agency, but it is easier to see everything yourself. The main sights of Granada are Iglesia La Merced Church, from whose tower you can see the whole city, the Museum of Chocolate, Park Central de Granada.</p><h3>Leon</h3><p>Leon is the former capital and second-largest city in Nicaragua, and it has many ancient churches and Spanish mansions. In the central square is the Le\u00f3n Cathedral (UNESCO has protected it since 2011). Visit the Museum of the Revolution and the University. On the west side of the city is the old El fortune Fort, which had served as a prison for a long time. Graffiti and mural lovers will appreciate the art of local artists who depicted the Civil War era on the city walls, in paints. Leon is in one of the hottest regions in the country, and beautiful beaches are only half an hour away. Like any city in Nicaragua, there are beautiful temples here: the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe and the Church of Xalteva. We recommend visiting the Chocolate Museum, the cultural center of the Monastery of St. Francis, the Maria Romero House Museum and the railway station (previously the railway was the main transport of the country). Ten kilometers from the city, there is a Mombacho volcano, but you will have to climb to a height of 1200 meters on foot or by truck. It's cold upstairs, but the view is worth it!</p><h3>Estel\u00ed</h3><p>Estel\u00ed is significantly different from other cities in the country. It is in the north of the country, 150 kilometers from Managua, about 2-3 hours by bus. You can also get here from Leon. The climate here is colder than the rest of the country, and the locals are more like Europeans by the color of skin and hair. Prices for accommodation are higher than in other cities, so it makes sense to look for it in advance. We recommend excursions to the Tisey Estanzuela Natural Reserve and the tobacco factory. The first one offers the waterfall of Estanzuela and La Garnacha farm, where cheese is made. In the factory, you can see the whole procedure of tobacco processing and cigar making. There are several museums worthy of your attention in the city: Heroes and Martyrs of May 18th Museum and the Museum of History and Archaeology. They are small, so you will definitely have time to see the Cathedral of Our Lady and walk in Central Park. A few tens of kilometers from the city, there are the Miraflor, Tepesomoto-Pataste Natural Reserves, and the Ecological Park of Cantagallo. The best way to get to them is by car.</p><p>In general, all cities in Nicaragua are built up to 3 floors due to seismic activity. The population is religious, mainly Catholic, and each town has at least two cathedrals.</p>"

There are many predatory and poisonous creatures in the waters, but swimming on the beaches is absolutely safe \u2014 all of them are located in areas safely closed by reefs."

            "en": "<p>On average, people divide Puerto Rico into five tourist regions \u2014 northern, central, southern, eastern, and western.&nbsp;</p><h3>San Juan</h3><p>You will most definitely visit the northern region as its central city is the capital of San Juan. You can arrive at this place in a line boat as it is one of the largest cruise ports in the world. You may also fly to Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport. Other airports provide civil flight connections between the islands. In San Jose, tourists admire the ancient architecture (Old San Juan) where they attend old castles and forts: Castillo San Felipe del Morro, San Crist\u00f3bal, El Morro, Santa Catalina's Palace, Monastery Convento de Los Dominicos. Just like any other capital, San Juan is the cultural center with a diversity of museums and art galleries. You can also explore the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera Park with the XVIII-century Armoury Chamber and Pavilion of Peace that has many displays. Enjoy a ride in a cable railway in Parque Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn and admire impressive views. And don't forget to get a tour of Bacardi Rum Factory. If you are looking for something extraordinary, go to the cock-fighting club and check out the traditional local entertainment. However, keep in mind that this is quite a violent spectacle that is done for the sake of bets.</p><h3>Carolina</h3><p>The municipality of Carolina is located in the northeastern region. Here you can relax in luxurious hotels or head to the private Hacienda Campo Rico Rancho. It offers a chance to feed exotic animals, go horse riding, do archery, and head to a trip to jungles in special quadricycles.&nbsp;</p><h3>El Yunque National Forest</h3><p>The eastern region is renowned for El Yunque National Forest that is situated 40 km southeast from San Juan. The local citizens frequently call it the main attraction. Here you can enjoy a walk around tropical jungles, get to the Yokah\u00fa Observation Tower, swim in the waterfall, taste water from the mountain stream, or drink some coconut milk.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fajardo</h3><p>A large city-port Fajardo is also located in the east. It treats its guests to beautiful beaches where they can admire stunning sunsets every evening. The local cuisine is renowned for its freshly-cooked and delicious seafood. Take a special tram to take a tour of the beautiful mangrove of Las Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve and the historic Cape San Juan Light. Besides the architecture of the old town, Fajardo is famous for its proximity to one of the five bioluminescent bays of Puerto Rico. To see the neon, illuminated by plankton bay, you can take a tour in a kayak and admire this incredible spectacle in Laguna Grande. A similar place is nearby the island of Vieques, where the plankton is considered to be the brightest. This island also has marvelous beaches that are not so famous due to its remoteness. Besides, it has beaches for swimming, snorkeling, and surfing. By the way, in Fajardo, you can find a ship to get to Vieques and Culebra. You can also reach the latter by place as there is a small airport there. Dewey is the principal city in Culebra. The island itself is small and attractive to travelers who can't wait to lay on snow-white beaches (Flamenco Beach and other), admire the reefs, and dive.</p><h3>Ponce</h3><p>Ponce is a central city for a visit in the south part of Puerto Rico. It had been the capital till 1898. It can be deservedly called the center of historical and cultural monuments. In this matter, it can even compete with the current capital. When you wander around Ponce, you will literally breathe in the spirit of the epoch as the ancient cathedrals (the majority of citizens of Puerto Rico are Catholics) neighbor on buildings in the Colonial style and fountains. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center recreates the village of the Arawak tribe \u2014 the first settlers of the city. In various museums, you can get acquainted with the history, culture, and music of Puerto Rico. The themed Parque de Bombas stands out significantly on the background of other attractions. This museum is devoted to the history of fire fighting on the island dozens of years ago. You can leave for a small Gilligan's Island from Ponce. Lovers of diving will appreciate the coral reefs and exotic fish in the neighboring waters.&nbsp;</p><h3>Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del R\u00edo Camuy</h3><p>Not far from Ponce, you shall find one of the largest complexes of karstic caves in the world \u2014 the Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del R\u00edo Camuy. Once, the Indian tribes used to hide in this cave system. Nowadays, tourists admire the stalactites, stalagmites, and ornaments made of calcareous rocks. Here you can use ropes and go down into the famous Cathedral Cave where the Taino Indians' petroglyphs were found. And the local underground river called Camuy is one of the largest in the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mayag\u00fcez</h3><p>Though every beach in Puerto Rico is lovely, the west coast offers the best of them. The best beaches for water sports and diving can be found nearby Mayag\u00fcez. The city has the only zoo in Puerto Rico that has animals from North America and the Caribbean Sea Basin. The main attractions include the oldest Catholic church called Porta Coeli, which was built in 1609, Cabo Rojo, and Punta Higuera Lighthouses. By the way, you can take splendid landscape photographs from the lighthouses, especially at sunset. Mayag\u00fcez is one of the largest seaports in Puerto Rico. That's why there is no problem taking a motorboat tour or even visit another city from its harbor if you don't mind traveling by water.</p><p>The Arecibo Observatory is the attractions that made Puerto Rico famous in terms of scientific-researches. It has one of the largest radio telescopes in the world (304 meters in diameter). The observatory is located almost 500 meters up in the mountains, fifteen kilometers away from the town of Arecibo in the northwest of the island. Here you can admire the views and learn more about how humanity is trying to explore space with the help of an enormous aluminum \"plate\".</p>"

            "en": "<h3>San Salvador</h3>\n\nSan Salvador, the country's capital, is the main city in all aspects. The town is located near the volcano of the same name, and it has often suffered from earthquakes in its history. However, in recent years, the capital is building only earthquake-proof buildings, and constructions of the medieval era have mostly survived, despite the violent temper of the volcano. San Salvador has preserved quite a few examples of colonial architecture; at the same time, there are many modern high-rise buildings.\n        There are undoubtedly many churches in the Catholic city, and some of them are very original despite the antiquity. The most unusual church in the town, El Rosario, does not look like a religious institution at all. There are plenty of restaurants and nightclubs to see and enjoy in San Salvador.\n\n<p>There are also a lot of exciting things in the suburbs of the capital. There are the ruins of Cihuat\u00e1n, a Mayan city founded in the X century, 39 kilometers from San Salvador. The ancient settlement of Hoya de Ceren, which is called the American Pompeii, is 25 km away. In the year 600, a large Mayan village was buried under a layer of ash, just like an ancient Roman city.</p><h3>Santa Ana</h3><p>Santa Ana is the second-largest and most important city in El Salvador. The first settlement here was founded before the Spanish, and it was called Sihuatehuac\u00e1n (Place of the Priestesses). The city is located in a very picturesque area, in the Chiautehuacan Valley, which is surrounded by three volcanoes. Santa Ana has always attracted wealthy Salvadorans who have been living here for a long time and built luxury villas. The most prosperous quarters of the city are located on the shores of the charming Lake Coatepeque.</p><p>The magnificent Gothic Cathedral of Santa Ana is a fascinating building of the local theatre, in the appearance of which one can guess the features of classicism and neo-Gothic. And the exquisite construction of the local municipality has a patio turned into a small botanical garden. The city has many restaurants and cafes where guests can taste the masterpieces of local cuisine. There are plenty of shops, street markets and places for entertainment.</p><p>However, the human-made beauty of the city cannot surpass the majesty of the surrounding natural landscape. Three volcanoes (Santa Ana, Izalco, and Cerro Verde) rise above the plain like the teeth of a giant crown. The Cerro Verde crater, located 14 km from Santa Ana, is a National Nature Reserve.</p><h3>Suchitoto</h3><p>The small town of Suchitoto is located on the shore of Lake Lago de Suchitlan. Despite its modest size, it is considered to be the most beautiful city in the country. The city amazes with the abundance of pretty colonial buildings, tidiness, accuracy, and provincial calmness. And what about the magnificent landscapes around! By the way, from the language of the Nahua people, Suchitoto is translated as the \"city of flowers and birds\". This romantic name fits it perfectly. As a cultural site, it is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The ruins of Ciudad Vieja, the country's first capital, are located eight kilometers from Suchitoto.</p><h3>San Miguel</h3><p>San Miguel will inevitably attract those in search of entertainment. This bustling and fun city is one of El Salvador's major commercial centers. The town has both large shops and very attractive markets where you can buy interesting souvenirs. The main street of the city, Roosevelt Avenue, splits it into two parts \u2014 old and modern. The ancient town impresses everyone with its colonial architecture, while the new town consists of more modern buildings. Roosevelt Avenue itself is the apotheosis of the entertainment industry, with numerous restaurants, discos, cafes, and nightclubs along the way. The Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paz, which begins in November and lasts almost two months, bring the most fame and popularity to the city. It is one of the main cultural events, not only in El Salvador but in Central America as a whole</p><h3>Costa del Sol</h3><p>El Salvador will please the beach lovers with numerous resorts located on the Pacific coast. Costa del Sol is probably the most popular beach in El Salvador. It gives tourists a wonderful combination of pure sand and mangroves. There is a well-developed infrastructure. There are plenty of chic and quite budget hotels, cozy villas, restaurants, and cafes in the coastal zone. As Costa del Sol often hosts many international congresses and seminars, the resort has high-class amenities. Among other things, this area allows you to tour the mangrove canals, and discover the fantastic world of tropical nature</p><h3>Ilopango</h3><p>The small town of Ilopango, located near the capital of the country, will not surprise tourists with its ancient architecture. It simply does not have any. But the city is located on the shore of a huge crater Lake Ilopango and is one of the leading resorts of El Salvador. People come here just to lie on the beach, and for diving, riding a yacht, kayak, or scooter. And the landscapes around Lake Ilopango are simply mind-blowing!</p>"

            "en": "All the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are so different from something familiar and everyday-grey that a holiday on any of them is like a separate short life. The man's influence on their natural beauty is very smart and dosed. Enough so that the stay here was comfortable and pleasant. But at the same time, there is still a feeling of disconnection from civilization. Maybe that's why these beautiful places have more than once become a location for shooting Hollywood movies and a reality show \"Survivor\"."

            "en": "Saint Lucia is situated on the island of the same name within the Lesser Antilles archipelago. It borders on the island of Martinique to the north (along the Saint Lucia Channel) and Saint Vincent to the south (along the strait of the same name). The Atlantic Ocean washes it in the east and the Caribbean Sea in the west (the total coastline length is 158 km). The area of the country is 617 square kilometers. Saint Lucia is of volcanic origin and is, therefore, more mountainous than the majority of other islands in the Caribbean Sea. In the south-west, there is the Pitons volcanic range, which includes the volcanoes of Gros Piton and Petit Piton. The highest point of the island is Mount Gimie (950 meters).There are traces of volcano activity on the territory of Saint Lucia \u2014 hot springs, lava fields, and sulfur deposits. The slopes of the volcanic massif are covered with tropical forests. The coastline is indented with numerous lagoons, bays, and harbors. There are small but gorgeous coral reefs along the coast.Saint Lucia is divided into 11 regions (parishes). Each has its own local government \u2014 city and village councils."

            "en": "<h3>Castries</h3>\n\nCastries is the capital of Saint Lucia and is located in a natural harbor. The resort's trademark is its gorgeous beaches. Vigie Beach is the most favorite among locals and tourists. Here you can enjoy the best views, swim in the warm azure waves, put your feet in the snow-white sand, and watch the passing ships. After sunbathing, take a walk along the hospitable Castries.\n        Among the architectural monuments, here you can see Fort Charlotte, constructed in the XVIII century, the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception \u2014 the largest in the Caribbean \u2014 and visit the Le Pavillon Royal Museum. Another unique place is Pigeon Island National Park. It has become home to many exotic plants, animals, and birds, including the famous grey parrot.\n\n<h3>Gros Islet</h3><p>Gros Islet is a quiet, picturesque town with simple wooden houses and small shops where you can always buy a bottle of rum. Its shores are covered with many colorful boats with smiling fishers. The main attraction of Gros Islet is the St. Joseph the Worker Church (XIX century), which rises on the outskirts of the city. There is also an authentic local market where you can buy something as a souvenir. Pink coral reefs can be spotted off the coast of the island and are best seen while diving. And most importantly, the beaches, beaches, and beaches again! One of the most beautiful is Reduit Beach. Its wide strip offers wonderful views of Pigeon Island and the green coastal hills.</p><h3>Soufri\u00e8re</h3><p>Soufri\u00e8re is the oldest and incredibly picturesque town in Saint Lucia. It spreads out in a beautiful deep bay by the extinct Petit Piton. Its landscapes have made Soufri\u00e8re famous in the film industry. It was here that the scenes of \"Superman 2\", \"Water\", and \"White Scream\" were shot. It's impossible not to fall in love with the contrasts of this place. Bright houses, standing against the background of green hills, create an atmosphere of a fairytale. You can walk around the city in an hour and a half. During the stroll, you can explore the architecture and visit a cozy local cafe. Next to the town's seafront, there is a small handicraft center where you can buy handmade souvenirs by local craftsmen. Soufri\u00e8re is a great place to get to know the island's life and enjoy its natural beauty.</p><h3>Vieux Fort</h3><p>The bustling city of Vieux Fort is a harmonious blend of ancient wooden buildings, modern architecture, and natural attractions. The second international airport of the country, Hewanorra International Airport, is located here and as well as St. Lucia's largest fishing fleet. The seaside highway of Vieux Fora is packed with restaurants, shops, and bars, where the nightlife is bustling. Major attractions include the Maria Islands Nature Reserve, Coconut Bay, and Des Sables Beach on Des Sables Point and the Cape Moule a Chique Lighthouse on top of a 250m hill (near the city). And if you want to conquer the wave, welcome to Mistral Club. It's the best place on the island for windsurfing. The Mankote Mangrove protected forest strip is another fantastic natural attraction in the surrounding area.</p><h3>Dennery</h3><p>Dennery is the fishing center of the island and a great place for ecological tourism. The city itself will not surprise the traveler with a large number of attractions and developed infrastructure. Still, it will allow you to dive into the local flavor, go fishing in a canoe, and enjoy the exotic. Another advantage of the city is that it serves as a starting point for visiting the most picturesque places on the east coast. For example, from here you can go on a tour of the old plantations of the region, learn about traditional ways of growing and processing cocoa, fruits, and other fruit crops. The wide Grand Anse Beach is 10 km north of Dennery, where the endangered species of sea turtles lay their eggs. In the near future, there are plans to create a nature reserve here.</p>"

This heavenly place attracts tourists from all over the world. Here you will find luxurious white beaches, developed infrastructure, and cheerful nightlife in all restaurants, discos, and casinos. One of the local attractions is the airport, which is among the most dangerous on the planet. This is due to the very close proximity of its territory to the beach. Therefore, planes literally take off above the heads of holidaymakers. Those tired of beach holidays will be curious to visit Fort Amsterdam (1631). It is funny that American brown pelicans have chosen this place for their habitat. About 280 hectares near the fortress are recognized as key ornithological areas, where you can see many species of birds."

That is why guests here are welcomed by kilometers of luxurious beaches, almost untouched nature, excellent service, and a wide range of amusements. The capital city of Port of Spain can delight with a bizarre mixture of historic and modern buildings. Stollmeyer's Castle and National Academy for the Performing Arts are excellent examples of this contrast. The most popular beach locations are in Maracas Bay (Trinidad) and Buccoo (Tobago). Caroni Bird Sanctuary, Asa Wright Nature Centre, and Caroni Swamps are ideal for ecotourism. History and exotic lovers will enjoy a trip to the oldest settlements on the islands \u2014 the fishing village of Charlotteville and Arima Town."

            "en": "<h3>Kingston</h3>\n\nKingston is the capital of Jamaica. A rare example of a central city in the country that's difficult to overpraise. There are no outstanding historical attractions and unusual museums, it can not boast of the title of a popular beach resort, and strolling down its streets is not always safe, to be honest. But Kingston is still worth a visit for its unique atmosphere of the Jamaican capital.\n        For a memorable city experience, go to Caymanas Park race track and bet on a quick and beautiful horse, drink a cocktail on Nutsford Boulevard, dive into the roots of reggae culture at the Bob Marley Museum. Don't forget to check out the main attraction \u2014 the home of the first black millionaire George Stiebel. And remember, either hang out in the center before the sunset or jump in the shuttle bus and go to a more popular and safe resort like Montego Bay.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Montego Bay</h3><p>Montego Bay is a large port city and a popular beach resort in Jamaica. Here you will find restaurants, hotels, bars, and loud nightclubs. At sunset, you can stroll to the sea along the half-ruined streets in the Gregorian style. Make sure you visit the Museum of St. James, where you'll discover the history of slavery. For those who love active leisure, there's plenty to do: float on the Martha Brae or Black Rivers, hike in the Blue Mountains, or dive.&nbsp;</p><h3>Negril</h3><p>If you get tired of faceless skyscrapers, dirty enterprises, and the noise of Montego Bay, head to cozy Negril. The main attraction of the resort is 10 kilometers of wide white beaches. A vacation in this paradise corner will be really carefree. Being away from the excesses of civilization, all you will have to do is to admire the colorful sunset from the rocky terrace of Rick's Caf\u00e9, scuba dive by the picturesque coral island Booby Cay (the best diving spot in Jamaica) and lounge in the warm sun on the beach. You can only have fun on a trip to the nearby town of Appleton, where you'll be told how the traditional Jamaican rum is produced.</p><h3>Ocho Rios</h3><p>Ocho Rios is a resort town that is lost among a dozen cozy bays and picturesque capes of fishing villages and ancient towns, on the shore of Discovery Bay. The main attraction in Ocho Rios is the opportunity to gaze at the huge cruise liners that stop at the city port. Otherwise, the resort is quite typical for Jamaica: it has its own reggae museum, a quiet city park, and a huge selection of hotels. For a change, you can visit Dunn's River Falls, the Valley of Fern, and coffee plantations.</p><h3>Mandeville</h3><p>The most English city in Jamaica is Mandeville. There are many old colonial buildings in the city center. The parish church and clock tower, North Caribbean University, and English pub the Manchester Arms deserve your attention. Mandeville is the only major settlement on the island with no street access to the sea or river. The lack of beaches here is more than compensated for by the eco-tourism opportunities, as in recent years, Mandeville has gained fame as a mountain climate resort. Local guides offer various options for hiking in the Blue Mountains. If you're on a coffee plantation, make sure you buy a pack of the fragrant black beverage to remember Jamaica while sipping coffee on the couch at home.&nbsp;</p><h3>Port Antonio</h3><p>Every country has an extraordinary place of recreation for wealthy people. In Jamaica, this is Port Antonio \u2014 a cozy town on the east coast of the island. A former Spanish colony is nowadays famous for its luxurious hotels and restaurants according to local standards. The city is surrounded by jungle with exotic animals. In the surrounding areas, you will find waterfalls falling from the rocks directly into the sea, and the coastal waters are a marine reserve area. But the renowned Blue Lagoon, where the film of the same name was shot, is the most attractive place for tourists.&nbsp;</p><h3>Runaway Bay</h3><p>Another resort town, Runaway Bay, is buried in the lush greenery of the harbor. Many years ago, the sea pirates shouted \"Yo-ho-ho\" in the caves of Runaway and the Green Grotto and shared their loot. Nowadays, it is a tourist destination, where the sun-dammed vacationers head for a tour. Active leisure opportunities at the resort are very diverse. You can sail on a yacht, windsurf, and if you get bored, try water skiing or gain experience from diving and snorkeling. Besides, Runaway Bay is the first city that Columbus saw and where Bob Marley was born. At the same time, it is also a world-famous nudist resort. So, choose the beach carefully, especially if you're on vacation with your children.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Canberra</h3>\n\nCanberra is the capital of Australia. It doesn't have its own international airport, so many tourists don't even come here. They are pretty much satisfied with Sydney and Melbourne. However, they make a huge mistake, as Canberra is the embodiment of Australia's true spirit. It's a peaceful, measured, green city, where every street is designed in detail. Canberra's main task is to govern the country fairly. That's why there are no toxic industries, no bustling business quarters, and no indefatigable resorts.\n        First of all, it's worth visiting the Parliament Building buried in luxurious gardens, the Australian National Gallery, the Botanical Garden which occupies 50 hectares and displays unique species of plants, the Australian War Memorial and Black Mountain, which offers a great panoramic view of the city.\n\n<h3>Sydney</h3><p>Sydney is the business center and financial capital of Australia. It seems like the postcards come alive here: the Harbour Bridge floating over the harbor, the petals of the Sydney Opera House, the sparkling wheeled ferries and the beautiful surfers of Bondi Beach. The Rocks district in Sydney literally marks the beginning of a new history in Australia. Here you can eat delicious dinners and simply stroll the streets laid down by the first colonizers; try on the bohemian mood in modern museums and art galleries of the Darling Harbour district; relax from the hustle and bustle of the big city in the Royal Botanic Gardens; watch hilarious sea lions performing in Taronga Zoo and attend an organ concert in St. Mary's Cathedral.&nbsp;</p><h3>Melbourne</h3><p>Melbourne is Australia's cultural and sports center, located on the shores of Port Phillip Bay. It has been recognized as the most comfortable city to live in and deserves this status. Believe us, you don't want to leave a kind, clean, intelligent Melbourne. Here you can admire the mystical glow of thousands of mirror balls during the White Night, bet on the Melbourne Cup Carnival and laugh from the heart at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. You can also check out the colorful graffiti at the Rutledge Lane open-air gallery, drink cocktails at the bars on Chapel Street and support your favorite on Australia's Formula 1 Grand Prix tour.&nbsp;</p><h3>Brisbane</h3><p>Brisbane is the largest city on the east coast. Despite its charm, the state capital of Queensland has a transit function. The local airport hosts many local and international airlines, so tourists usually stay in Brisbane waiting for a flight or spend a day or two before heading to the Gold Coast. But since you are here, do not waste your time in a hotel.

Here, as nowhere else in the world, there is an incredible amount of respect for the King and his family. Tonga is one of the last absolute monarchies on the planet. A couple of centuries ago, its citizens, who took part in the burial of the ruler, had their hand cut off so that it would not be desecrated in everyday life after touching the monarch. This rule does not exist now, but still, people do not use their hands for more than 100 days. They do not work or even eat with this hand, and they are fully served at home. Travelers come to Tonga for great diving and fishing, to enjoy the solitude on the beautiful wild beaches where it is rare to meet tourists, to get acquainted with fascinating, unusual local culture and customs. And, of course, to be the first people on the globe to meet the sunrise."

The city has no industry at all, and its main attraction is the Royal Palace. However, it is inaccessible to locals and tourists, who can only see its facades through the fence. All year round, orchids growing here are a real highlight of the capital. Nuku'alofa is also known for its white sandy beaches. The largest of them is Ha'atafu Beach. It's popular with surfers. From April to November, the trade winds blow here, raising waves. They also come here for diving activities.\n        In the coral reef area, there are shipwrecks where you can swim next to humpback whales. In the suburbs of Nuku'alofa, there are ruins of defensive constructions of ancient civilizations of Oceania.\n\n<h3>The Vava'u Island Group</h3><p>In this corner, nature has created unique opportunities for fishing and diving. Throughout the year, the water transparency here exceeds 30, and in some places \u2014 even 50 meters. The islands are also famous for their caves. Their walls are covered with soft multicolored corals, and extraordinary fish swim in the water. The Mt Talau National Park and the Ene'io Botanical Garden are also worth seeing. From May to October, the islands have a yachting season. The administrative center of the Vava'u Island Group is Neiafu, the second-largest city in Tonga. Travel agencies offer whale watching tours here. However, such tours should only be accompanied by a guide accredited by the Ministry of Fish Resources. Humpback whales come here to mate and breed, and their activity peaks are in July and September. Diving is prohibited near these marine mammals, but it is possible to swim at a distance of 30 meters.</p><h3>Niua Islands</h3><p>Niua Islands are located 400 km from the capital of Tonga. It is difficult to get here as transport does not operate regularly. The local landmark is an active volcano. Last century, it erupted four times, and now there is a lake with hot springs in its crater. The isolation of the local population allowed them to avoid western influence and preserve their identity. It is here that you can see traditional Polynesian culture in the villages, climb to the top of the extinct Tafahi Volcano, relax on volcanic beaches.</p><h3>\u02bbEua Island</h3><p>\u02bbEua Island is the only one with a river. It can be of interest to hikers. This hilly stretch of land is the largest tropical forest in Tonga. It has wild sandy beaches on the west side and cliffs on the east side. It is also a paradise for diving and snorkeling enthusiasts, with whales coming to its shores. James Cook has been to \u02bbEua twice, in 1773 and 1777.</p>"

Here, wild thickets and waterfalls sit next to modern restaurants, where you can try something that is not served anywhere else in the world. It is hard to believe that, 200 years ago, Europeans were afraid to land on the islands even for a short time. The reason for that is the fame of cannibals, which is firmly anchored in the natives of Fiji. Today, their ancient settlements particularly attract many tourists.

Here are the best beaches of the famous \"Coral Coast\" and the most comfortable hotels. It is worth visiting the Fiji Museum in Suva. It displays exhibits that will tell you about the island's history and culture. In particular, there is a 13-meter watercraft in the museum that locals used to travel on more than 100 years ago. From Viti Levu, you can make an excursion to neighboring islands, such as Beqa. It is worth getting to know the Sawau tribe, whose representatives entertain tourists by walking on hot rocks. The Sri Siva Subramaniya temple in Nadi is a must-see. This Hindu sanctuary is considered to be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><h3>Vanua Levu</h3><p>Vanua Levu is Fiji's second-largest island. It attracts tourists with coral reefs and picturesque nature. Here you can go scuba diving, which captivates with the visibility up to 50 meters deep. This is probably the only place on earth where so many shark species can be seen. In order to put on a show, specialists attract them by fish scraps. On the whole, this entertainment is safe, but you should take into account that bull, tiger, and grey sharks, which are also found here, are not harmless at all. Don't forget to explore Mount Nasorolevu \u2014 it is the highest point in the area.

This is the island where the past meets the future. It's where the 180th meridian runs, which means the international date line is here. So if it's Tuesday on the west side of the island, it's Wednesday on the east side. There is even a place where tourists take pictures with one foot in \"today\" and the other foot in \"yesterday\". Taveuni is also called an \"island of soft corals\". After all, here you can see the picturesque views of beaches and tropical forests. Mount Uluigalau (1,241m high) is also an eye-catcher, which you must definitely climb to enjoy the views. Visit the village of Waiyevo. Only here, you can see rare birds \u2014 predatory hawks, peregrine falcons, endemic parrots, and wild pigeons. Visit the Bouma National Heritage Park, where the delightful nature and the waterfalls will meet you. You can even have a picnic here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kadavu</h3><p>Kadavu is the fourth-largest island in the archipelago. The remarkable coral reefs of Astrolabe, Namalata, Solo, and Tavuki, stretching for tens of meters. The unique nature of the tropics, mountain slopes, and snow-white sandy beaches are the hallmarks of this area. The neat houses of local villagers complete the picture. It is an ideal place for diving, snorkeling, sea fishing, and leisurely nature contemplation.</p><h3>Ovalau</h3><p>Ovalau. This island will be interesting for lovers of exotic holidays. Here is the city of Levuka \u2014 the capital of Fiji until 1882. Mount Nandelaiovalau attracts tourists, the height of which reaches 626 m. Other attractions include the buildings in the style of the Wild West. The beaches with stony bottoms are not very attractive, and there are few of them.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Buenos Aires</h3>\n\nThe capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, is translated from Spanish as \"Good Winds\" or \"Good Air\". Its inhabitants themselves often call it \"a city with different names\" and use the abbreviated name Baires or Capital Federal. Till the XVII century, the city had borne a difficultly remembered name given to it by the founder of city Pedro de Mendoza: \"City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\". The citizens of the capital call themselves, \"Portenos\", which means \"inhabitants of the port\".\n        As Buenos Aires stands on the shores of a giant bay, it has remained the largest port in the area for centuries. The city is so multifaceted that you need at least a week to get to know it. Old quarters with ancient mansions, churches, and narrow paved streets stand side by side with districts with skyscrapers made of glass and concrete. Although it may look a bit unusual, tourists are often offered to attend a cemetery as one of the attractions. It bears the same name as the quarter does, Recoleta. There are burial places of many celebrities of the country, some of which are recognized as historical monuments. The real tourist pilgrimage centers are the colorful La Boca Quarter, Piazza San Martin, the Teatro Col\u00f3n, the Cathedral, the Congress, the Casa Rosada Pink House, and the Obelisk on the broadest July 9 Avenue. You should also definitely attend the traditional tango shows and cozy city cafes.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Salta</h3><p>Salta is like a beautiful lady. Perhaps, that's what the Argentines call Salta. The city, located in a cozy valley between two mountain ranges, and is extremely popular among tourists. It was Salta that managed to preserve the extraordinary colonial charm of beautiful mansions and temples, cozy houses with toy balconies, and winding streets buried in orange trees. Traveling on one of the world's highest mountain railways is especially popular with tourists. It is called the \"Road to the clouds\" because most of the way the train really does travel in the clouds, finishing its route in the mountains at an altitude of more than four thousand meters. The route passes through 29 bridges, 12 viaducts, 21 tunnels, and many spirals and zigzags, so the experience of such a journey remains unforgettable. In the city itself, the central square is the best place to start sightseeing. There you shall find the Cathedral, built back in the XVI century with the miraculous statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ. Locals believe that they can save their city from earthquakes and cure any disease. The Monastery of St. Francis, built in the style of neoclassicism by Italian Luigi Giorgi, is another attraction of the city. It is also worth visiting the local Town Hall, where the History Museum is now located. And if you want to buy souvenirs, you should go to the colorful city market.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rosario</h3><p>Rosario is the third-largest city in the country and home to the legendary Latin American revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. It still has the house where he was born with the memorial plaque and a four-meter-long monument to a famous countryman. This city also gave the country many prominent football players: Lionel Messi, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Fabian di Maria, Mauro Icardi, and many others. Football is like a cult here. Rosario even held matches of the 1978 World Cup. A journey through the city should begin with the center, where the Parque de la Independencia (Independence Park) spreads for over a thousand square meters. In addition to the beautiful gardens, fountains, and sculptures, there are several museums, a children's garden, a racetrack, and a municipal stadium. The city is also famous for being home to the national flag of the country. In honor of this event, a Memorial of the same name was opened in the city. The highest part of the monument is the 70-meter tall tower, where you can admire the magnificent panoramic view of the town. We advise you to plan time for a walk through the historic city center and admire the architecture of the Cathedral Basilica Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary, the famous Palace of the Lions, and other attractions. Rosario will not be boring at all. There are many shopping centers, night clubs, restaurants, and casinos.&nbsp;</p><h3>El Calafate</h3><p>El Calafate is a town located on the banks of Lago Argentino, the country's largest freshwater lake. El Calafate owes its name to a plant common for Patagonia, box-leaved barberry knows as \"el calafate\" in the local language. This bush with yellow flowers and black berries grows everywhere, and the locals make extraordinarily tasty jams from its fruits. The city was founded in the late 1920s but became popular only after the creation of the Los Glaciares National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Glaciers, mountain peaks, clear waters of lakes Lago Argentino and Viedma, as well as graceful cougars \u2014 all this attracts tourists from all over the world in El Calafate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Puerto Iguaz\u00fa</h3><p>Puerto Iguaz\u00fa is another city whose treasury is filled mainly by tourists visiting numerous restaurants and hotels. It is from here they go on excursions to the famous waterfalls of the Iguazu River, which are on the border with Brazil. The river flows for almost 3 kilometers from here, forming a cascade of 270 individual waterfalls. This spectacle deserves your admiration.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ushuaia</h3><p>Ushuaia is the port city in Argentina and the capital of the province of Tierra del Fuego. Ushuaia is considered to be the southernmost city on Earth, although, to be fair, there are several other small villages to the south. Tierra del Fuego National Park and the Martial Glacier are the main tourist attraction here. The local prison is not quite ordinary, but a fascinating object to visit. It houses a museum nowadays. You can even take a ride on the \"Prisoner Train\", an exact copy of the ones that once transported prisoners.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Rio de Janeiro</h3>\n\nThe most famous city in Brazil is Rio de Janeiro. Until 1960, it had been the capital of the republic. Tourists are attracted here by the largest carnival, the famous statue of Christ the Savior, and no less popular beach Copacabana, stretching along the coast for 4 km. Rio de Janeiro is a paradise for fans of sightseeing. You can admire the city from the Sugarloaf Mountain observation deck or Mount Corcovado. In addition, it is worth visiting the Botanical Garden and the world's largest urban forest Tijuca, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Museum in Rio.\n        The Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, which steps are lined with mosaic tiles, can add bright colors to your trip. If we talk about beach destinations other than Copacabana, other beaches also deserve your attention. They include Ipanema (calm and safe), Leblon (respectable and luxurious), Arpoador (stony but not crowded), Joatinga (hard to reach but deserted).\n\n<h3>Brasilia</h3><p>Brasilia is the capital of the republic, which is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In its layout, Brasilia resembles an airplane or a bird with open wings. The city was built in 3 years and designed to be as convenient and comfortable as possible for living. There are practically no industrial enterprises, but many parks and architectural sights. The most famous and beautiful buildings in the capital are the result of the work of architect Oscar Niemeyer. Here you can walk around the Palaces of Supreme Court and Justice, check out the Presidential Palace, evaluate the exposition of the National Museum, visit the National Theatre. Attention should also be paid to the largest urbanized National Park, which is considered to be the pride of the region. The beauty of the sunset is another highlight of the capital.&nbsp;</p><h3>Salvador</h3><p>Salvador is one of the most colorful and fun cities in the country. The atmosphere of colonial Brazil reigns here. One can guess the features of African and Portuguese culture in local architecture. The city is divided into upper and lower parts, which are connected by a special city elevator. Here you can admire the beautiful squares, cathedral, fort, walk in the park of Costa Azul or visit the Garden of Lovers. Salvador can boast of a large number of museums: numismatics, archaeology and ethnology, Afro-Brazilian Museum, and others. Fans of capoeira, a martial art that is demonstrated daily by masters in the Pelouri\u00f1o squares and near the Mercado Modelo market, will definitely love this city.</p><h3>S\u00e3o Paulo</h3><p>S\u00e3o Paulo is the cultural capital of Brazil, a center of entertainment and vibrant life. The city is beautiful both day and night. It is worth starting the walk from the central square of Pra\u00e7a da Se, where you can easily reach Brazil's largest campus. The Government House, the Ibirapuera Park, the Cathedral, and the Museum of Painting also deserve your attention. The highlight of the city is the unique Liberdade district. It's the center of Japanese culture in Brazil. Here you can dive into Japanese traditions, admire whimsical arches, check out Japanese restaurants, pamper yourself with various purchases. In the evening, the city of Sao Paulo does not fall asleep, and meets tourists in dance clubs and the night wholesale market, which is called \"The Belly of Paris\".</p><h3>Foz do Igua\u00e7u</h3><p>Foz do Igua\u00e7u is a small town that would not be remarkable for tourists if it were not for two facts. The first one is the proximity of the famous Iguaz\u00fa Falls, which are only 20 km from here. The second fact is that there are three national borders (Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay). You can get to Iguaz\u00fa Falls by bus or by taxi. The park of the same name is located on the territory of two countries \u2014 Brazil and Argentina. Still, it is from Foz do Igua\u00e7u that the most picturesque views are opened, including Devil's Throat. You can admire the waterfalls from the observation deck, or while a tour on a motorboat or helicopter. Visitors can also visit a museum and a bird park.&nbsp;</p><h3>Manaus</h3><p>Manaus is a city on the banks of the Amazon, the capital of Amazonia. One of the most fascinating, ecologically clean, and, at the same time, frightening places on earth. The city is inhabited mainly by Indians, and the wild nature is the essential feature of these places. Exotic lovers come here for day and night tours of the Amazon, as well as walking in the tropical forest. Another highlight of Manaus is the so-called \"Wedding of the Rivers\". It is a unique natural phenomenon, the confluence of two rivers (the Rio Negro and Solimoes). Their waters do not mix and flow in parallel for 2 kilometers. In addition to the natural attractions, Manaus offers the opportunity to admire the local architecture decorated with blue ceramics and go shopping at a real floating market.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Sucre</h3>\n\nSucre is the constitutional capital of Bolivia, but the main state institutions are located in La Paz. There are many snow-white buildings with fiery red roofs, so it is often called the \"white city\". Its architecture has no analogs in the world. In 1991, the old, historic part of the city was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Compared to other cities in Bolivia, it amazes tourists with its pure and unusual beauty of architecture. The main square is home to the Government Palace, built in Baroque style in the late XIX century.\n        Today, it houses the building of the Prefecture of the Department of Chuquisaca. Lovers of more secluded rest can walk around the surroundings with charming streets, and visit La Glorieta Castle \u2014 national treasure with octagonal towers, arched portico, and a high minaret with a dome. There are also several fascinating museums in the city: historical, ethnographic and folklore, and military.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>La Paz</h3><p>La Paz (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz) is the actual capital of the country because it is home to the residences of the President and Government of Bolivia, and also has the status of the highest mountain capital in the world. Millions of years ago, this place was the crater of a huge volcano at an altitude of 3,600 meters. The mountainous terrain that has survived since then gives the city a unique feature: it resembles a large bowl in which roads \"flow\" into the city through the top and \"flow\" downwards. If you are going to visit La Paz, don't forget to bring warm clothes. The average annual temperature ranges from +7\u00b0C to +11\u00b0C, and in July, it's only +4\u00b0C. Palacio Quemado, which means \"Burned Palace\", is of particular interest to tourists. In the historical center, on Plaza Murillo, there is the Capitol. Along the square, there are many houses and churches decorated with sculptures. A small street, Calle Jaen, which is famous for its colonial-style buildings, gives the city a special charm. You can buy souvenirs from magicians and shamans at the Witches' Market (El Mercado de las Brujas).</p><h3>Cochabamba</h3><p>Cochabamba is a huge metropolis, 220 km southeast of La Paz, nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains. It is called a \"garden city\" for its numerous parks and gardens. The mild climate allows the cultivation of grapes and cereals, as well as citrus fruits. The symbol of the city is the statue of Jesus Christ (Cristo de la Concordia) installed on Mount San Pedro. The height of the monument is 34.2 m. You can climb the mountain with a cable car. A staircase with 1399 steps leads to the observation deck, which offers a magnificent panorama of the city. The central square of the town is interesting with its colonial buildings, which are surrounded on all sides by palm trees. One of the most impressive buildings is the Santa Teresa convent. It is worth taking a tour to see this ancient architectural structure. From the top of the monastery chapel, you can easily see all the beauties of the city. You will not regret it if you visit the most interesting archaeological museum.</p><h3>Santa Cruz de la Sierra</h3><p>Santa Cruz de la Sierra is the largest city in the country and its economic center, located in the eastern part, on the Piraeus River. A mild foothill climate, a large number of different artifacts from the colonial era, and the status of \"Gateway to Brazil\" have made the city a major tourist destination. Plaza 24 September is one of the main attractions. Since cars are not allowed to pass through the square, walking on it will be a real pleasure. The Santa Cruz de la Sierra Cathedral is also the city's main Catholic temple. Visitors can climb the bell towers and admire the surroundings. Inside the temple, there is a Museum of Church Art with unique collections of attributes of church life. Locals love spending time in Parque El Arenal, where there is an Ethnographic and Folklore Museum with collections of Indian household items. Flora and fauna lovers should definitely visit the Biocentro Guembe. Here, under a giant net dome, is located the world's largest butterfly nursery. And, of course, nobody will leave indifferent by the wealthiest collection of orchids that the park is famous for. By the way, all necessary infrastructure is created for visitors: hotels, bungalows, tent towns, cafes, and restaurants. The city also has the largest water park in Bolivia.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tarija</h3><p>Tarija is another fascinating city in Bolivia. Once, traveling around the country, the nomadic Indians found a beautiful valley, which later was called Tarifa (translated as \"happily found\"). This is where they settled. The city is famous for its \"bodegas\" \u2014 distilleries that make excellent wines and win prizes at various competitions. As the city is close to the border with Argentina, there are parrilladas \u2014 establishments specializing in cooking different kinds of grilled meat. Many cafes and restaurants are located on the banks of the canyons, so after a delicious lunch, you can take a boat ride admiring the local beauties.</p>"

Owing to its natural treasure, Venezuela is one of the fascinating countries in South America. The name of the county translates as \u201cLittle Venice\u201d. The thing is that the houses of the Indians built on piles and standing in the water looked like the Italian town to the European colonizers.

It grew on the place of the settlement of the Indian tribe \u201ccaracas\u201d that was destroyed by the Spaniards in 1567. The old colonial site of Caracas was practically destroyed during the oil crisis in the XX century. Back then, the giant skyscrapers used to grow here like mushrooms after the rain. However, you can still find plenty of fascinating architectural objects here.\n        Thus, you can\u2019t miss Caracas Cathedral at Bolivar Square; the house where Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was born, who was the liberator of the country from the Spanish domination; the Miraflores Palace; the Capilla de Santa Rosa where the independence of Venezuela was proclaimed; the National Pantheon of Venezuela. Besides, Caracas offers a diversity of museums with quite interesting and valuable collections.\n\n<h3>Maracaibo</h3><p>Maracaibo is the second in size city in the country. Till the beginning of the XX century, it had been a shabby provincial township. However, when deposits of oil and gas were found here, it transformed dramatically. Many industrial corporations, a port, airport, contemporary multi-storied quarters appeared in the city. At the same time, Maracaibo has some colonial buildings in an excellent state \u2014 the XVII-century Basilica of Our Lady of Chiquinquir\u00e1 and neo-Gothic Saint Barbara Church. The Palace of the Eagles and Plaza de Toros Monumental for fifteen thousand spectators also attracts plenty of tourists. However, the majority of travelers head to Lake Maracaibo in the first place. They aspire to see the famous Catatumbo lightning that occurs 150 times per year in the estuary of the same-name river that flows into the lake. The local citizens call this extraordinary natural phenomenon \u201cthe Lighthouse of Maracaibo\u201d. Usually, you can observe it during the raining season when it\u2019s dark. However, it may also occur throughout the year. The best way to admire the flashes of lightning is to stay in the Indian house built on piles or simply lay in the hammock (they are hanging between the trees here), and\u2026 wait.&nbsp;</p><h3>Coro</h3><p>Coro is the former outpost of Venezuela\u2019s colonization and its first capital. The architectural and historical monuments in a good state of preservation helped to include the city to the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites. Colorful houses, bricked streets, the famous House of the Iron Windows, Balc\u00f3n de Los Arcaya, Treasure House, and the oldest Jewish cemetery on the South American continent \u2014 the ancient city offers all of these and more to every traveler. You can wander around Coro for days come across fascinating sites, buildings, and attractions literally at every corner.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ciudad Bol\u00edvar</h3><p>Ciudad Bol\u00edvar is one of the centers that participated in the struggle for independence at the beginning of the XIX century. That\u2019s why it bears the name of Simon Bolivar. Nowadays, it\u2019s a large industrial center and a river port located on the right bank of the Orinoco River. The historical center offers colonial buildings in a good state of preservation: San Isidro House Museum with a marvelous park, an ancient house of the governor, a former building of a prison, the XIX-century Cathedral. In Ciudad Bol\u00edvar Airport, you can see the restored Jimmie Angel\u2019s plane parked forever in front of the building. He was the one who discovered the tallest waterfall in the world. Angel Falls is 979 meters in height. During the raining season, it transmits 300 thousand liters of water every second. However, at the same time, Angel Falls is also an almost inaccessible waterfall on the planet. It\u2019s a real challenge to reach it \u2014 there are no roads or hotels nearby. However, this fact doesn\u2019t stop all the adventure-seekers who are ready to overcome all the difficulties to admire it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Isla Margarita</h3><p>Isla Margarita is a genuine pearl of the Caribbean Sea. It received this nickname not only for the abundance of pearls in the nearshore zone but also for several hundred kilometers of golden beaches, pure water, tropical forests, mountains, waterfalls, and rivers. It seems that the comparatively tiny territory of the island gathers everything one may desire for a marvelous vacation. The tropical climate, the average year-round temperature of +30, and plenty of sunny days create perfect conditions for full relaxation. This place attracts fans of surfing, windsurfing, and kiting as there are winds of the required intensity almost the year-round. Experts explain that this happens due to the particular direction of the circulation in the atmosphere. Moreover, guests can try horse-riding expeditions, cycling, flying on hydroplanes, sea fishing, and fascinating excursions. In addition to that, it\u2019s hard to resist the tax-free zone. In other words, Margarita can steal a way into the heart of every tourist once and forever.</p>"

Even the capital city has no buildings higher than three floors. Now it is a poor, extremely superstitious state, where you can still see unusual magical rituals. And at the same time, it is a religious state where every Sunday its citizens diligently attend church. There are no indigenous people in cities \u2014 they live in forests and most often lead a nomadic life. The main Guyanese wealth is unique nature.

In the impenetrable jungle of the Amazon, where no man has set foot, there are still rare plant and animal species. Only the \"red-book list\" of the latter is approaching six hundred points. Indeed, the damage caused to local nature by mining (mainly oil) is also enormous. By the way, it is in Colombia where over 90% of all emeralds in the world are extracted. The tribes of Indians known as Ticuna, Maku, Inga, Sicuani sill live here, as well as hundreds of years ago, in unison with nature, fishing, hunting, and farming. There are only about 60 tribes. According to rough estimates of scientists, each of them has not more than a thousand people."

            "en": "<h3>Bogota</h3>\n\nBogota is both the capital and the largest city in Colombia. It is often called the city of extremes. Masterpieces of magnificent colonial architecture stand next to super modern skyscrapers and dirty huts. The narrow streets climbing the mountain slopes are equally indifferent to luxury cars and mule driven carts. It has many pocket thieves and drug dealers, but at the same time, Bogota amazes with the number of museums. It is a museum of gold and emerald, with the zest represented by a 265-carat crystal.\n        Moreover, there are national, archaeological, religious art, maritime, numismatics displays. Besides, the city has several houses-museums of outstanding Colombians: Simon Bolivar and Gabriel Garcia Marquesa. People in Bogota treat their historical heritage very reverently. For example, if the owner of an ancient building preserves and maintains its original appearance, he is exempt from paying taxes. In 50 kilometers from the capital, you will find the unusual cathedral carved in salt rock. Its vault and walls covered with salt crystals create an absolutely fantastic atmosphere. The temple can accommodate up to ten thousand people at a time.\n\n<h3>Medell\u00edn</h3><p>Medell\u00edn is a former mining village that today has grown to be the second-largest and most important city in Colombia. It is also called the \"City of Eternal Spring\" because of its comfortable climate, and the \"Silver Bowl\" because seven picturesque hills surround it. Medellin is always ready to offer its guests the most exciting things. There are beautifully preserved buildings from the colonial era \u2014 the Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Candelaria and the Metropolitan Cathedral, known as the largest bricked church in South America. The inhabitants are proud of the famous Botanical Garden with its unique collection of orchids and the 175-meter high needle-shaped tower, symbolizing the achievements of the textile industry. And of course, Medellin is known for being the place where Pablo Escobar had founded and had been ruling his bloody drug business for almost a quarter of a century. You can even see the slums where the drug lord ran his business. It is true that now the authorities are doing everything to make this page of history forgotten. The original system of escalators and the ropeway made life much easier for slum residents glued to the mountain slopes. Schools, libraries and theatres have been opened here \u2014 the interests of young people have gradually shifted from wars between groups to sports.</p><h3>Cartagena</h3><p>Cartagena is a port city on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, also known as \"Latin American Venice\". The date of its foundation is considered 1532, when during the \"gold rush\", it was through its port that gold and gems were exported to Europe. At that time, these waters were dominated by the Flibustiers. That's why Cartagena is an extremely fortified city. The walls of one of the local fortresses are 12 meters thick. The Palace of Inquisition, with its exposition of instruments of torture, and Las Bovedas prison, which now houses a shopping center, are well preserved. And the former convent of Cartagena now houses a history museum. The Rosario and San Bernardo Corals National Natural Park is 40 kilometers away from the city, where tourists can see picturesque beaches and the only underwater park in the country. For scuba enthusiasts, the island of Baro has become a real magnet, with its diving center and a beautiful coral garden.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cali</h3><p>Cali has been an unremarkable quiet town for quite a long time. But nowadays, it is the third-largest metropolis in the country, dynamically developing due to coffee and sugar production. And Cali is also called the \"capital of salsa\", the most popular Latin American dance. You can watch its performance, or even take a couple of lessons in the numerous salsa-halls. And if you're lucky, you can get to the annual festival, where the best city dance schools are presented. The handmade monuments of the city are also worth seeing. First of all, these are the temples of the XVI century and numerous ancient hacienda mansions. It is also worth visiting Cerro de Las Tres Cruces, which offers a stunning view of the city. And on Easter, it becomes a traditional pilgrimage site.</p><h3>Popay\u00e1n</h3><p>Due to the abundance of perfectly preserved mansions painted in light colors, Popayan is often called the \"white city\". It has managed, better than many others, to keep the appearance of the colonial period as if it had stopped the running of time. And now visitors of the city can admire the many ancient churches - Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Iglesia de San Francisco, Iglesia de La Ermita, and the Convento de San Agust\u00edn. This city is also home to one of the oldest universities in the country, founded in 1827. You should also visit the museums, including the natural history, colonial and religious art, as well as the museum devoted to the poet Guillermo Valencia.</p><h3>Barranquilla</h3><p>Barranquilla is the sea and air gate of the country. Port city and the cradle of Colombian aviation. This is where the first airport in South America appeared, and the famous Colombian coffee begins its journey around the world from the seaport. But the real hallmark of the city is the world-famous carnival El Joselito. It is held four days before the Great Lent. At this time, Barranquilla attracts a huge number of Colombians and tourists from all over the planet. After all, this carnival is called one of the most spectacular events on the planet, not worse than the famous festival in Rio de Janeiro. By the way, there is a lifetime monument to Shakira, because the famous singer is from Barranquilla.</p>"

In the capital itself and its closest surroundings, you will find the largest number of attractions of Paraguay, ancient churches and monasteries.

It is located on the banks of the Paran\u00e1 River, near the borders of Brazil and Argentina. Ciudad del Este is a duty-free zone and is actually one large market. Its entire economy is trade-oriented, which is why the city is often referred to as \"South American Hong Kong\". It was founded in 1957, although it was initially called Puerto Flor de Lis. Then dictator Stroessner \"gave\" his name to the city, and only since 1989, it has its present name. Unlike other cities in the country, Ciudad del Este is multinational. The majority of its population is made up of foreigners, primarily from Asian countries: Koreans, Thais, Arabs, Iranians. Accordingly, one can find mosques and pagodas in the city. And the main local attraction is a huge Friendship Bridge, connecting the Brazilian and Paraguayan banks of the Parana River. It is worth visiting Ciudad del Este, at least for shopping. Everything is much cheaper here than in other South American cities.</p><h3>Encarnaci\u00f3n</h3><p>Encarnaci\u00f3n is a city that is close to the Argentine border. It was founded in 1615. Every year in February, a colorful festival is held here. Moreover, festive processions are held every Sunday of the month. There are several old colonial-style buildings in the city. The city park is also of interest, which is dedicated to migrants who came to Paraguay from different countries. There is, for example, an Italian piece of land and a small Japanese park. But the main attractions are located near the city. These are the Jesuit missions Misi\u00f3n Jesu\u00edtica de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad and Jesuit Mission of Jes\u00fas de Tavarang\u00fce, both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. One of them is located 28 km away and the other 31 km from Encarnaci\u00f3n.</p><h3>Caacup\u00e9</h3><p>The city of Caacup\u00e9, located in the southern part of the country, is known for its unique Catholic temple - the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Miracles. It is one of the main sanctuaries of Paraguay, which is visited by about a million pilgrims annually. According to legend, in this place, in 1600, the Virgin Mary presented herself to one of the local Indians. The cathedral was visited by Pope John Paul II and the present Pope Francis.</p><h3>Itaugua</h3><p>Itaugua is a small town, but it' s quite remarkable in its own way. Firstly, it is famous for being the birthplace of many famous people in Paraguay \u2014 artists, musicians, singers, and poets. Secondly, Itaugua is the capital of Paraguayan nandut\u00ed lace weaving. The name itself translates as \"cobweb\".

According to the administrative division, Peru consists of 25 regions. Geographically, it is divided into four natural zones. The first is the coastal zone, or \"Costa\". It has a comfortable temperature from +16 \u00b0C to +25 \u00b0C almost all year round. Though \"Costa\" is very poor in terms of vegetation, the diverse animal world adds charm to this region. Here you can find flamingos, penguins, and even sea lions. However, for this area (which, by the way, involves the capital Lima) is characterized by a very unusual type of precipitation - very thin drizzle, \"garua\". It complicates the life of the metropolis. The Andean zone or \"Sierra\" is the next zone. The temperature range is from +5 \u00b0C in winter to +20 \u00b0C in summer. The \"pune\" begins above the level of 3.5 thousand meters. It is a zone of highlands, with a characteristic harsh climate and sharp daily temperature differences from + 28 \u00b0C during the day to -12 \u00b0C at night. The peaks are covered with eternal ice, mountain sickness, avalanches, and other \"delights\" attract lovers of active and extreme rest here.

It is a modern city that whimsically combines the latest achievements of civilization and traditions of the ancient Indians. In its streets, skyscrapers made of glass and concrete stand next to wooden huts, and business suits of clerks with colorful traditional clothes. The unusual relief of Lima is one of its main features: its slopes, steep cliffs, and hills.\n        The historic center of the city is a real monument of the Spanish colonial era, which is added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Presidential Palace, the catacombs of Saint Francis Monastery, the Cathedral are the real tourist Mecca of the capital. The value of real estate here is calculated in millions of dollars. Lima is also called a megalopolis of beaches, and there are more than five dozen of them here.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Cusco</h3><p>Cusco is the capital of the ancient Inca Empire, which is the most visited by tourists. The famous mountain lake Titicaca Near is located near the city. It is surrounded by a thousand legends, mysteries, and fables. According to them, it was from the waters of Lake Titicaca that the first Incas came to shore and founded the city of Cusco. The conquistadors spoke with admiration about the beautiful town, with gold and silver temples, about the water pipeline, about the magnificent stonework. The new modern houses still stand on the remains of their foundations. This is what attracts tourists today \u2014 a mixture of new and old, which has become a unique style peculiar only to this country. When you are in the heart of the city, on the Plaza de Armas, you should see the magnificent colonial-style buildings and the majestic Cathedral with its black Saviour statue. The San Blas slope is another scenic spot. This is almost a vertical street with numerous souvenir shops, craft workshops, and exhibition salons.</p><h3>Machu Picchu</h3><p>The main highlight is located near Cuzco. It is the ancient town of Machu Picchu, one of the most mysterious places on Earth, belonging to the \"New Seven Wonders of the World\". Due to its remoteness, it was not destroyed by conquistadors, and its stone walls could not be damaged by earthquakes or landslides. And yet, science has not been able to unravel the main mystery of Machu Picchu, the reason for the puzzling disappearance of all its inhabitants until now.&nbsp;</p><h3>Trujillo</h3><p>Trujillo is another beautiful city in Peru, located on the Pacific coast. The culture of the ancient Indians, intertwined with the colonial style, made this city truly unique. There is another tourist attraction in Peru less than 10 kilometers from Trujillo, the ruins of Chan Chan, once considered to be the capital of the Chimu Indians. Excursions to the ancient pyramids of the Moon and Sun are another must-see during your stay here. Besides tourists, surfers from all over the world are also more than happy to come here.</p><h3>Iquitos</h3><p>Iquitos is the administrative center of the Loreto region, the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. Surrounded by impassable countryside, it is interesting for its unique and inimitable nature. The town owes its origin on the map of Peru to the so-called \"rubber fever\". The extraction, processing, and trade of the rubber tree juice gave a sharp boost to its development in the XIX century, and oil deposits were discovered in the XX century. However, most of the historical monuments here date back to the times of \"rubber fever\", when rapidly becoming wealthy planters tried to impress the imagination of their neighbors, building fabulous mansions. The so-called Iron House\" is, perhaps, the brightest of them. The famous Gustave Eiffel designed this building. Less than 50 kilometers from the city, there are two natural attractions at once - the Ayapuayo-Mishana National Reserve and the butterfly farm. By the way, there are many medicinal plants, from which local pharmacists produce various drugs in the tropical forests around Iquitos.</p><h3>Arequipa</h3><p>Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city, is located in the mountainous area at the foot of a sleeping volcano. It is so compact that most of its attractions can be accessed even on foot, using the services of local taxi drivers only occasionally. The Arequipa attracts not just tourists, but also fans of outdoor activities such as climbing and rafting. There is a Valley of Volcanoes nearby. This is a place of pilgrimage for tourists attracted by a peculiar \"lunar\" landscape of the area. Travelers bring products made of alpaca wool and vicu\u00f1a from Arequipa - here they are of the highest quality.</p>"

The Falkland Islands consist of about 780 islands. Stanley is the capital city. The archipelago is a real animal paradise where endemics can be found. It is home to sheep, black-browed albatrosses, crested penguins, sea lions, orcas, dolphins, and whales. On the archipelago, you can see the traces of British battles with Argentina \u2014 minefields and burned helicopters. When visiting Stanley, it is worth checking out the Government house, where you can leave a note about your visit in a special guest book. Another important building in the Falkland Islands is Christ Church Cathedral. It is the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world. Next to it is an arch of the jaws of two blue whales. It was erected in 1933 to mark the century of British leadership."

He gathered it all in one place \u2014 exactly where Chile is today. The country is visited by more than 2 million tourists every year, and this number keeps growing. You should come here to admire the natural beauties, to solve the mystery of the statues on Easter Island, to taste local cuisine, to walk through tiny villages, and bustling metropolises.

The city is located in the zone of increased seismic activity and has already experienced more than 40 earthquakes. That is why not all the sights and historic buildings have survived to our time.\n        However, here you can still walk around the Plaza de Armas, see the Governor's House, the Main Post Office, the municipality, the Royal Auditorium building, visit a performance at the Opera and Ballet Theatre, explore the city museums and appreciate the beauty of La Moneda Palace. Mount San Cristobal deserves special attention. You can reach it on foot, by cable car, or by taxi. There is the Metropolitano Park at the top of the mountain, a comfortable recreation area with outdoor pools, walkways, and a zoo. One of the features of Santiago is its unique administrative system. Prestigious and respectable regions are on the outskirts, not in the center. One of them is Bellavista, which is considered to be the most bustling and lively area and where restaurants, bars, and numerous nightclubs are concentrated.\n\n<h3>Valparaiso</h3><p>Valparaiso is a city of sailors and poets, the pearl of the Pacific Ocean, a paradise valley. Each of these titles reflects the features of the town, its free spirit, cheerful mood, and bright colors. Valparaiso is located on the hills, so it uses quite unusual public transport \u2014 funiculars. There are 15 lifts in the city, and some of them were built over 100 years ago. When coming to Valparaiso, tourists can enjoy the beach holiday, admire the surrounding nature, and visit local attractions. You can start exploring the area from the Hill of the Immaculate Conception, which offers a stunning view of the city. Beautiful houses with bright roofs and forged fences are another feature of this place. In Valparaiso, tourists should also visit the Fresco Museum, visit the Pablo Neruda houses, see the display of the Marine Museum, and walk around Plaza Sotomayor.</p><h3>Talca</h3><p>Talca is a small town, which can hardly be called attractive from the point of view of tourism. It will not offer you amazing monuments and world-famous sights. But Talca is a special city for every resident of Chile, because it is here, in 1818, the country gained independence. The attractions of the town include prestigious universities, the Cathedral, the unique Church of the Sacred Heart of Mary. Visiting the suburbs will also be a fascinating experience, especially in the Radal Siete Tazas National Park, where you can admire waterfalls, beautiful cypress groves, and unusual plants.</p><h3>Iquique</h3><p>Iquique is Chile's largest fishing port and has a unique free trade zone in addition to exciting sights. It is located in the northern part of the city and covers an area of 240 hectares. Prices for goods in this zone are 19% lower than standard, but one person can spend here not more than $1000. Besides shopping, Iquique offers its guests fantastic local museums, to stroll along Baquedano Street and to admire unusual houses with carved shutters, ornate verandas, and balustrades. The surrounding area is also worth seeing, especially the Atacama desert and the huge saltpeter factories that can be visited on tour.</p><h3>Valdivia</h3><p>Valdivia is one of the most beautiful cities in Chile, which attracts tourists with its picturesque nature. The city is located on four rivers, which means that the river walk is an obligatory point of the cultural program. During this tour, you can admire the Botanical Garden, see Teja Island, Austral University, and also visit the fish market. In addition, when you come to Valdivia, you should visit the German beer restaurant called \"La Cerveceria Kunstmann\", see the colony of sea lions on the waterfront, visit the neighboring towns of Niebla and Corral. If you plan a trip in the second half of February, you can get to the famous \"Valdivian Night\" \u2014 a brilliant performance with decorated boats, fireworks, and music.</p>"

Today, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in South America. Its historic center was one of the first sites in the world to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List. It is the old part of the city, with its colonial buildings, that enjoys well-deserved attention of tourists. However, it would be best if you were in good physical shape to explore the city.\n        The fact is that the streets of Quito are famous for their steepness, and after running up and down the avenues, not every tourist will have enough strength to admire the local sights. But, the Moorish-style Carondelet Palace, Plaza de la Independencia, and South America's oldest church, the Church and Convent of St. Francis, are must-see!\n\n<h3>Guayaquil</h3><p>Guayaquil, the country's largest city, is also its main commercial center. An international airport, oil processing plants, a seaport, and modern skyscrapers stand side by side with monuments of antiquity. There are lots of resorts for beach lovers. Machalilla National Park, with huge colonies of albatrosses and frigates, is of great interest. From June to September in the old port of Puerto L\u00f3pez, you can watch whales. An excellent observation deck was equipped for this purpose.</p><h3>Cuenca</h3><p>Cuenca is Ecuador's third-largest city. Like Quito, it is listed by UNESCO for its unique historical colonial buildings. Cuenca is by right called the most beautiful city in the country. It is also a city of students, as it is home to several major universities, including the oldest one in the country. Cuenca has a famous hat factory, as well as many small businesses producing hats, which are supplied to almost all countries on the continent. Another highlight of the city is the hot springs, where you can find the entire SPA-empires.&nbsp;</p><h3>Riobamba</h3><p>Riobamba is a real colonial town, with narrow, paved with uncut stone, streets and pastel houses. This is what gives the city its own unique flavor. There is a huge market on Saturdays, right in the streets, where you can buy everything - spices, herbs, food, animals, national clothes, and souvenirs literally. You should also check out the St. Peter Cathedral, the municipality, and Maldonado Park.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ambato</h3><p>They call Ambato the \"Garden-City of Ecuador\". Oranges, peaches, apples, grapes, and strawberries are grown in the vicinity of this city. The city regularly hosts flower and fruit fairs. Tourists will be offered a glass of fragrant locally produced wine in almost every street cafe.</p><h3>Galapagos Islands</h3><p>The Galapagos Islands are often the main reason why people visit Ecuador. The archipelago of volcanic origin, consisting of 13 islands with a total area of about eight thousand square kilometers, is rightly considered the main attraction of the country. Tourists can also take yacht cruises, diving tours to underwater beauties, as well as walks around the islands. By the way, they have the status of the World Biosphere Reserve and are protected by UNESCO. Here you can meet giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises, sea iguanas, endemic species of penguins, sea lions. In coastal waters, one can meet sharks, whales, and orcas. Almost the entire territory of the Turtle Islands is part of the National park of Ecuador. An adult tourist will have to pay100 dollars to enter it while it is half cheaper for a child. After a visit to this place, the famous explorer Charles Darwin created his theory of evolution. And not the less prominent Thor Heyerdahl tried to find Inca treasures on the islands in the middle of the 20th century.</p>"

The capital of the state is the port city of Conakry on the Atlantic coast. Next to it is the picturesque island group Ile de Los, an excellent place for picnics and beach holidays.

People come here to climb Mount Loura, to get acquainted with the local flavor in the towns of Mamou, Dalaba, and Mali, to see the waterfalls of Kinkon Falls and Bafara. Explore the almost unspoiled nature of Guinea in the reserves of Mount Nimba and Badiar and the National Park of Upper Niger.

The sun shines here all year round, and the sea is madly beautiful and always warm. The sea depths enchant with coral shelves and rich marine flora and fauna.

It also includes islands in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea. The Mediterranean Sea washes it in the north and the Red Sea in the east. It borders with Sudan in the south, Israel and the partially recognized State of Palestine in the north-east, and Libya in the west. Egypt's maritime borders are with Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The Suez Canal, owned by Egypt, allows ships to pass both ways between Europe and Asia, without bypassing Africa. The main ports of the channel are Port Said in the north and Suez in the south. The second-largest river in the world, the Nile, flows through the whole territory of Egypt and has become the cradle of ancient Egyptian civilization. More than ninety percent of the country's total population has lived in its coastal strip since ancient times to this day."

            "en": "<h3>Cairo</h3>\n\nStart exploring the country from Cairo, the capital of Egypt. This city is of special importance to the Islamic world. It's often called the city of thousands of minarets. It's home to about ten million people. In Cairo, the branches of history are intertwined: modern skyscrapers do not create dissonance with ancient mosques. Cairo is roughly divided into two parts: historical and contemporary. The old city is located on the east bank of the Nile. There are practically no new buildings on its territory; it is an area of ancient mosques.\n        But the modern part of Cairo does not differ from the usual urban landscapes. There are government buildings and office skyscrapers made of glass and concrete.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Alexandria</h3><p>Alexandria is the largest port city in Egypt, combining ancient Egyptian architectural structures and buildings in the Victorian colonial style. Comfortable beaches allow you to have a rest for the body, and rich culture offers attractions for the soul. Start exploring the city by visiting the National Museum, which is located in the center. The exhibits represent four historical eras: ancient, Greco-Roman, Coptic, and Islamic. Be sure to visit the catacombs of Kom el-Shouqafa. An unusual structure stores a whole network of funerary halls. The Pompey's Pillar \u2014 a famous monument of ancient times \u2014 is also popular with tourists. You should also admire the extraordinary architecture of the Egyptian Khedive's palace, the Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque and the Citadel of Qaitbay, built on the ruins of the lighthouse in Alexandria.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sharm El Sheikh</h3><p>Lovers of comfortable holidays go to the famous Sharm El Sheikh \u2014 a beautiful resort on the coast of the Red Sea. It is nominally divided into several areas. Sharm el Maya is the Old Town, where the famous oriental Old Bazaar with all kinds of goods and souvenirs is located. There is a beach with a gentle entrance, which especially pleases travelers with children and those who can not swim. The Hadaba area is also home to a dolphinarium and water park, brand boutiques, and the prestigious Dolce Vita nightclub. The Naama Bay area is home to cozy outdoor cafes and restaurants, nightclubs, high-end shopping malls, and a casino. It's also known as \"Arab Las Vegas.\" The renowned Cleo Park and the Promenade \u2014 a pedestrian walkway along the sea \u2014 are also situated here. Sharks Bay is 5 km from the airport and is famous for its hotels and diving center. Once you are at any of the beaches of the bay, you can see beautiful corals and many colored fish. So you should choose this area if you are planning to go snorkeling.</p><h3>Hurghada</h3><p>Hurghada is the place where the brilliant \"career\" of Egypt in the tourism business began. The construction of hotels in this area started in the 1980s and has not stopped until now. The dry climate all year round allows having a beach vacation almost without feeling the 40-degree heat. A flat entrance to the sea provides comfortable holidays with children. Those who will get tired of lying on the beach can go on excursions to the pyramids, in the Valley of Kings, or go scuba diving, surfing, and ATV racing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Marsa Alam</h3><p>Marsa Alam is a young resort, which many people have not yet heard of. It is located 300 km from Hurghada. The temperature here is a few degrees higher than in other resort towns. If recreation in Egypt always seems noisy and crowded, Marsa Alam is a quiet paradise. A small fishermen's settlement was located here not long ago. Nowadays, it is turning into a popular international resort. The main entertainment infrastructure is situated only in hotel complexes, but this does not prevent tourists from coming here and enjoying the warm waters of the Red Sea. Marsa Alam is also one of the best places in Egypt for kitesurfers.</p><h3>Giza</h3><p>When we hear about Giza, the imagination immediately draws the outlines of the Great Sphinx as well as the well-known pyramids: Cheops, Khafre, and Menkaure. The place is exciting because of the great history of ancient Egyptian burials. Not only the pharaohs, but also all their closest circle were buried here: wives, brothers, sisters, children, and servants. It's also worth coming here to see the Village of the Pharaohs. The tour starts with a barge ride along the canals. Moreover, Giza offers the largest zoo in Egypt, where the natural habitat for animals is created.&nbsp;</p><h3>Luxor</h3><p>Luxor is the city that once housed the capital of Ancient Egypt, Thebes. The city contains numerous treasures and architectural monuments included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The territory of the city is roughly divided into \"City of the Living\" and \"City of the Dead\". The \"City of the Living\" is a typical residential area, which occupies the right bank of the Nile. Tourists come here to see how ordinary Egyptians live and how the Luxor's temple looks like. \"The City of the Dead\" is located on the opposite side of the Nile. The wide diversity of archaeological sites beckons tourists. But you should mind that the climate here is hot enough, precipitation is a rare phenomenon, which is most often manifested in the form of dew.</p>"

            "en": "Cameroon is a country that was discovered by Portuguese sailors in 1480. The event took place near the Wouri River, which flows in Central Africa. Travelers did not think long about the name. After they had seen lots of shrimp in the river waters, the name came right away \u2014 Rio dos Camar\u00f5es. It was later transformed into \"Cameroon\", which literally means \"the River of Shrimps\". Today it is a major tourist center, which attracts by the fact that here you can see all the natural areas of Africa: evergreen forests, savannahs, and semi-deserts. Anyone who has visited Cameroon believes that this country is called Africa in a miniature. The locals love their guests and welcome them with pleasure. You will be told about ancient crafts and the love of football. They will show you the palaces of kings and sultans. They will also feed you with a delicious national dish called ndol\u00e9 (stewed fish or beef with bitter herbs and nuts). You can only taste it in Cameroon. After visiting this country, the impressions are bright and ambiguous, just like Africa itself."

The coastline stretches for 320 km. The country borders Nigeria, Chad, the Central African Republic, Gabon, the Republic of Congo, and Equatorial Guinea. Mount Cameroon, which rises to 4,095 m, is considered to be the highest point of the territory and is one of the most interesting sites for tourists. From the end of the XIX century until the end of the First World War (1918), Cameroon was a German colony. After the war, it was divided into two mandated territories, which were under British and French administration. In 1960, Cameroon became an independent state. It has two official languages, English and French. At the same time, there are at least a hundred dialects of local residents. The capital of the country is Yaound\u00e9. The largest city is Douala.

And that's because this West African country is the largest cocoa exporter in the world. But only a couple of centuries ago, the country was a major supplier of elephant tusks. Until 1986, its very name had sounded like the Coast of Ivory. The barbaric extermination of these animals led to a critical decline in their population. Now elephants are protected in national parks and reserves, but there are still very few (less than 800). Another example of contrasts in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is the presence of two quite modern capitals against a background of almost wild nature and other towns more like villages. The country, with four large universities and a significant French heritage, still has indigenous tribes. And the majestic ruins of the ghost town are peacefully nestled next to luxury hotels and lively beaches."

            "en": "Madagascar is a paradise island that lies in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. A hundred million years ago, the Mozambique Channel cut it off from Africa, leaving humanity a unique natural gift. The landscapes of the island are changing like kaleidoscope images, from wild relict forests in the north to the red desert lands in the south. The flat crowns of baobabs centuries-old nine-story high trees hold the sky, and the sharp spikes of the Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve stone forest make your blood turn into ice. Sapphires, emeralds, and topazes are washed in muddy waters of the rivers. White-tailed sifakas hide from fossas on the tops of the tropical forest, and the ring-tailed lemurs, the distant relatives of cartoon king Julian, are throwing parties in the thicket of the jungle."

            "en": "<h3>Antananarivo</h3>\n\nAntananarivo is an unusual and long word, isn't it? The Malagasy people call their capital and main city Tana. The city rests on the high hills inside the island. From dawn to dusk, it is buzzing with dozens of bazaars, where some people try to bring down the price, and others try to sell at a higher price. The ensemble of the palaces of Royal Hill of Ambohimanga, the burial vaults of the Malagasy monarchs, the red walls of the Baroque Andafiavaratra Palace \u2014 all of them stand out frighteningly against the mud and poverty of the poor quarters.\n        Lake Anosy is located at the heart of this heady mix. It was designed and artificially created by the English missionary James Cameron in the shape of a heart.\n\n<h3>Toliara</h3><p>Toliara grew among the desert with its thorny bushes in the cozy Bay of Saint-Augustin. It is a major port city in Madagascar. The 250-kilometer reef protects the city's coast from the dangers of the ocean and is also a mecca for diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. More than 200 species of coral, 760 species of fish, dolphins, turtles, tiger sharks, and ancient Latimeria \u2014 this underwater world is admirable. And when you see your fingertips wrinkling from a long stay in the water, go to the Reniala Private Reserve, where hundreds of species of birds will cheer you up \u2014 literally and figuratively.</p><h3>Antsiranana</h3><p>Antsiranana is a region in the north of the country, where hiking enthusiasts go to conquer the shaggy slopes of the mountains and the volcanic mountain range of Tsaratanana. Extreme adventures are waiting for travelers in Mahajanga area as well: narrow paths of the Tsingy de Bemaraha Reserve stone forest with peaks, sharp as a sword's blade, can take your breath away. Relax after active hiking through cool-down volcanoes and mangroves on the sandy beaches of Morondava, in the west of the island. The legendary Avenue of the Baobabs and Kirindy Forest, an ideal spot for observing lemurs, mongooses, and fossas, are all within easy reach.</p><h3>Nosy Boraha</h3><p>\"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\" - this is how pirates sang back in the XVII century, burying looted treasures on the island of Nosy Boraha (better known by its former name \u00cele Sainte-Marie). It is unknown whether it is true or not, but no gold deposits have been found on the island so far. But the fact is that the tourists love Ile Saint-Marie very much for its white beaches, clean ocean, and palm trees that slope low above the shore. The Torre del Homenaje, Ozama fortress, the churches of Saint Nicholas and Saint Francis, Alcazar castle \u2014 the island's colonial architecture will surely appeal to curious minds. And the cherry on the cake will be the watching of humpback whales: they twirl a flip over the waters of the strait near the island every year from July to September.</p><h3>Nosy Be</h3><p>In the north-west of Madagascar, there is another paradise place, the island of Nosy Be. It has experienced much during its centuries-long history. It was a refuge for pirates and a living embodiment of a treasure chest; a prison and hard labor for French colonizers; a slave trade center; it even had a fleet of Russian General Rozhestvensky. Today Nosy Be smells of coffee and ylang-ylang. In the forests of Lokobe Strict Reserve, black lemurs are jumping from one tree to another. Cold streams of waterfalls lull the cooled volcano. In the town of Djamandjary, they pour the world-famous Dzama rum. The Omura's whale, the rarest species of these mammals, demonstrate their fountains near the coast. Besides, it offers excellent hotels, gorgeous beaches, the best quality of service Madagascar has, and you won't be able to resist the temptation to book your own ticket to Madagascar.</p>"

In small towns, there are huts without water supply and electricity, made of clay bricks (here it is the main building material). People still turn to shamans for advice and help. He cures, gives pieces of advice in matters of love, work, protects from evil spirits, and other troubles. It is an agricultural country where every year (in December), the biggest cattle overlanding festival in Diafarabe takes place. During it, shepherds return to their families after several months in the desert. It is particularly impressive for the country's folk traditions and customs."

Rabat pleases the eye of the tourist with unique exhibits of museums of antiquity and art, minarets of Hassan Tower, and the Kasbah of the Udayas with its blue streets. And on Fridays, you can watch the King's departure ceremony for namaz at the Royal Palace.\n        You should also find time to visit the ruins of the ancient city of Sal\u00e9, founded more than 1000 years ago by the Phoenicians. This city was the capital of the corsairs that kept all Europe in fear in the XVII and XVIII centuries.&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Marrakesh</h3><p>Marrakesh is one of the oldest cities in the country and its former capital. The town is located at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. At dusk, Marrakesh's main square, Jemaa el-Fna, becomes a hub of fun. You can hear singing, jugglers, and dancers performing everywhere. Serpent and scorpion charmers strike the imagination of tourists. Acrobats and funny monkeys spin with puppets, and aromas coming from numerous fries can arouse the appetite of even the most sophisticated gourmet. Fortune-tellers and mysterious sorcerers add a mystical note to the atmosphere. Mornings in Marrakech begins with the voice of a muezzin standing on the tower of the beautiful Kutubiyya Mosque. You should definitely visit the Menara Gardens, the Bahia Palace, and the Mosque of the Booksellers.</p><h3>Fes</h3><p>Fes is the so-called religious capital of Morocco and the center of Islamic culture. It is the oldest city in the country, with an entangled labyrinth of ancient streets and a myriad of mosques. Fes has two medinas \u2014 Fes el-Jdid and Fes El Bali, surrounded by medieval walls and included to the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites. The world's oldest University of al-Qarawiyyin lies in the heart of the city. Fes is also known for its madrasas. These are educational institutions, such as boarding schools, which operated until the middle of the last century. In addition, the so-called Chouara Tannery is very popular with tourists, where the leather is still processed in the same way as it was thousands of years ago. Here you can also buy clothes, souvenirs, and leather goods.</p><h3>Casablanca</h3><p>Casablanca stands for a \"white house\" from Spanish. It is the largest port, business, and industrial center of the country. Corporate offices, bank headquarters, the largest airport, and the giant Hassan II Mosque, where 25,000 believers can simultaneously pray. It is a real paradise for tourists. The town offers numerous beaches, clubs, restaurants, Habous Quarter with its abundance of stalls and boutiques. It seems that its buildings have descended from the pictures of advertising campaigns. However, we should disappoint you a little \u2014 the famous film Casablanca was not filmed here!&nbsp;</p><h3>Agadir</h3><p>Agadir is a resort city. They say that it provides the country with half of all tourist income. The sun shines here 300 days a year, and elegant hotels seem to compete for the title of the best. Life always seems to be buzzing on the sandy beaches, with scuba diving, water skiing, yachting, and boat riding. It is also the most European city in Morocco. Women here practically do not wear a hijab. Of course, it's worth visiting the Bird Valley and Zoo and the local market that sells products made by skilled craftsmen. By the way, you have to bargain with them to get the best price.</p><h3>Chefchaouen</h3><p>Chefchaouen, by right, has the title of the most beautiful city in Morocco. It is known for the fact that the vast majority of buildings in it are entirely or partially painted blue. For several centuries, it had been forbidden for foreigners to visit Chefshauen on pain of death. Maybe that is why the city has retained its medieval appearance. It is said that even slaves were traded in the local markets until the 30s of the last century. Nowadays, you can easily buy marijuana in these markets. But it would be best if you did not do it, because the mere presence of it will be enough to spend from 3 months to 5 years in prison.</p>"

            "en": "<h3>Pretoria</h3>\n\nPretoria is the administrative capital of South Africa, combining magnificent architecture and an equally magnificent nature. It is decorated with picturesque residential and administrative buildings. Even the presidential residence here looks more like a fairy-tale palace. It seems that every block of the city has prepared a beautiful gift for the guests of Pretoria. Church Street, the longest street in the world, is waiting for you in the center. It is a landmark in its own right, with a length of 25 kilometers.\n        While walking along Church Street, you should take a closer look at the St. Alban the Martyr Anglican Cathedral, Palace of Justice, Mint, old post office, buildings of several banks \u2014 each of these constructions is unique in its own way. There are a lot of beautiful monuments, sculptural groups, and fountains in the city, and you can wander in the squares, parks, and gardens all day long. The Botanical Garden and the Zoo with their unique collections of flora and fauna, respectively, deserve special attention. There are many exciting museums in Pretoria. Fort Klapperkop will tell you about the events of the Anglo-Boer War, the National Museum of Culture of South Africa will introduce you to the cultural heritage, Melrose House will surprise with magnificent paintings, carpets, and porcelain, and the building itself is a beautiful masterpiece of the Victorian era. Pretoria also has one of the largest observatories in the country. And the tour to the real diamond mine, located next to the city, where you can see how diamonds are mined and processed, will surprise and delight even the most sophisticated tourists. By the way, at the beginning of the last century, a huge stone was found here, the size of an adult fist.\n\n<h3>Cape Town</h3><p>Cape Town is the legislative capital and the second-largest city in South Africa, which rightly claims also to be the cultural capital. It is located at the Cape of Good Hope and is one of the most prestigious resorts in the world. A must-see route for any tourist arriving in Cape Town is the ascent to Table Mountain, which has long been a symbol of the city. Kirstenbosch botanic garden, which is situated at the foot of the mountain, will also give a lot of impressions and fabulous pictures. Other rightfully renowned attractions of Cape Town include the Castle of Good Hope ( the oldest building in South Africa), St. George's Cathedral, Houses of Parliament, real Turkish baths, mosques, Victorian buildings, mansions in the Old Dutch style. As for the natural curiosities, it is impossible not to visit the beach with a very \"talking\" name - \"Boulders\". In addition to unusual stone groups and sculptures, here you can swim and sunbathe in the company of penguins. In recent years, there is a whole colony of these extraordinary birds, about two thousand individuals. And off the coast of Cape Town is Robben Island, where one of the terrifying prisons in Africa, where Nelson Mandela, a man who defied the apartheid regime, spent almost three decades.</p><h3>Bloemfontein</h3><p>Bloemfontein is the judicial capital of South Africa, and this is where the country's Supreme Court is located. In translation, its name stands for the \"City of Roses\" or \"Fountain of Flowers\". It is one of the cleanest and most well-groomed cities in the country, and it's the local nature that attracts attention in the first place. Gardens, parks, and squares, nature reserves, and sanctuaries \u2014 all of them definitely deserve your attention. The exuberance of smells, flowers, and the total diversity simply can not leave anyone indifferent. The view of all this magnificence can be seen from Naval Hill. You can still find the picture of a giant white horse on its slope, depicted here during the Anglo-Boer War as a signpost for riders. The architectural constructions that deserve your attention include the church with two spires, the first parliament building, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and the old presidential residence.</p><h3>Johannesburg</h3><p>Johannesburg is the largest city in the country. It is often referred to as the financial capital because it is where the main monetary and industrial projects are concentrated. It's also the air gateway to South Africa. Locals simply call their city \"Joburg\" or \"Johansburg\", and also \"Josie\" and \"Egoli\". At the end of the last century, it deserved the dubious glory of the most criminal metropolis in the country. Still, in recent years, the situation has improved significantly, although, in some areas, tourists should keep away from it. By the way, unlike most cities, the center is the most problematic in this respect, and the district of Soweto has earned the palm of the criminal championship. However, adrenaline enthusiasts often come here on tours. Unfortunately, there are very few impressive historical buildings in Johannesburg, except for the early XX century colonial-style town hall and a few mansions. But it has the tallest skyscraper in Africa, the 50-story \"Carlton\". Its observation deck is always included in the program of local sightseeing. By the number and richness of collections of local museums, Johannesburg can also outpace many cities. It offers the Transport Museum, Military Museum, African Museum, Apartheid Museum, Art Museum. And there's also a zoo to visit.</p><h3>Durban</h3><p>Durban is the third-largest city in South Africa, a fashionable resort with luxurious promenades, luxurious hotels, and almost ideal beaches. Durban's Golden Mile (the one where Vasco da Gama docked) will amaze even the most demanding guest. And the picturesque colonial architecture deserves the attention of tourists. The Town Hall is considered to be the most beautiful building in the city. It is decorated with columns and porticoes, a huge dome, and a couple of smaller ones, intricate balustrades, and original interiors. St. Paul's Church still looks like a portal to old England. And there is also the largest Indian community in Durban, which also gives the city a unique flavor. It has the largest Hindu temple in Africa and the largest mosque in the Southern Hemisphere. You should definitely get out to the picturesque Valley of a Thousand Hills and visit the snake reserve and crocodile farm from Durban.</p><h3>Port Elizabeth</h3><p>Port Elizabeth is a city on the Pacific coast that can also fascinate tourists with its magnificent architecture. The whole Donkin Street has been preserved here since the colonial past, with unusual monuments and exciting museums. But first of all, Port Elizabeth is a resort. Its beaches, marked by the \"blue flag\" for the exceptional purity of the water and coastline, have only one drawback - they are often overcrowded. It is a real paradise for diving and surfing enthusiasts. There is also a unique oceanarium, which includes a snake park. The Addo Elephant National Park is also located not far from the city, where a huge population of elephants (over 500 individuals) lives today. A trip there will be a really unforgettable experience.</p><h3>Kimberly</h3><p>Kimberly is the \"diamond\" capital of the country. In the late XIX century, adventurers and explorers from all over the world rushed here as everyone here had a chance to get rich in an instant with the help of local diamond deposits. The first huts of the miners became the foundation of this city. The so-called \"Big Hole\", where more than 30 thousand people worked every day, who manually extracted more than 22.5 million tons of soil, was the main place of their work. Their efforts were rewarded with a \"diamond\" harvest with a total yield of 2,722 tons. In 1914, the \"Big Hole\" was flooded, and diamond mining stopped here. A memorial to diggers was erected in Kimberley to commemorate the people who died here. However, valuable stones are still being mined in the vicinity of the city, and the locals gladly allow numerous tourists to watch this process. In addition to the sparkle of diamonds, Kimberley is also interesting for its natural attractions. Nearby, you will find the National Park and Flamingo Island, which is home to a population of up to 60 thousand individuals.</p>"
