For the same reason, a special tradition operated in the city until the end of the XX century. It consisted of the fact that local cemetery were excavated every ten years, and the bones of the dead were sent to the chapel. A city artist would paint the skulls with the dates of birth and death and indicate the deceased's occupation. After a few weeks, the remains would be displayed in a special ossuary, and new ones would appear in place of the old burials. Such a custom became obsolete with the advent of cremation. But still, any city dweller could show a desire to be buried according to the old custom.</p><p>The modern city is almost no better than its ancient counterpart.

Nottingham is located northwest of London, on the Trent River. Around the city lies Sherwood Forest. According to the legend, the famous robber Robin Hood lived and traded here. Today, his name is a symbol of romanticism and justice, as well as a hallmark of Nottingham. Streets, bars, and restaurants are named after this romantic robber, and a festival is held annually in his honor."

            "en": "\n  Nottingham has a rich history. The first settlements on its territory appeared around 600. It was home to Anglo-Saxon settlers who called their town Snottingham (after the Saxon leader Snot). It was situated on a hill from where the crossing of the River Trent was clearly visible. On another hill, in 1068, the Norman ruler William the Conqueror decided to build a castle and settlement for his people. So the Saxons and Normans began to cooperate and trade at the foot of the hills.\n        This neutral area was later called the Market Square, which has survived to this day and is now the center of the city.\n\n<p>Until 1300, the city consisted of separate French and English parts. Afterward, it united and received the status of a town with the rights of a county in 1449. In 1461, during the Wars of the Scarlet and White Roses, the king of England, Edward of York, was proclaimed in Nottingham. In those days, the city was a center for the production of wool and religious alabaster sculptures. Other industries soon began to develop \u2014 hosiery and lace. An entire quarter was even opened, which was called the Lace Market.</p><p>In 1667, the town's inhabitants suffered from a plague, and in 1795, there was a great flood. Another disaster came in 1833 when cholera killed a large part of the population.</p><p>The second half of the XVIII century was marked by the fact that in just 50 years, the city's population increased sharply from 10 to 50 thousand people. This led to a shortage of housing, jobs and the emergence of slums. The industrial revolution began. Many residents fought against the use of machines, calling themselves Luddites (after Ned Ludd, who first destroyed the loom). It ended with the Luddites setting fire to the Duke's palace in 1831.</p><p>However, with the development of new industries, the situation in the city began to improve. In 1839, the railroad was built in Nottingham, which connected it with Derby. The city gained independence in 1897.</p><p>At the beginning of World War II, Nottingham suffered from German bombing. This gave a new impetus to the development of the city. But many of the projects were inconsiderate and even ugly.</p><p>The modern city relied on the development of services, commerce, and industry \u2014 pharmaceutical, electrical, and electronics.</p>"

That is why the poetic name \"Franconian Rome\" was given to it. But this comparison does not limit the uniqueness of the city. Bamberg is self-sufficient and, in many ways, a dualistic city. It harmoniously combines Gothic and Baroque, modernity and traditions, religious buildings, and educational institutions. There are 11 breweries in Bamberg. The oldest of them was once housed within the walls of the Church of St. Michael, whose monks invented the famous beer \"Rauchbier.\" Bamberg also managed to preserve the appearance of the Middle Ages, as it miraculously survived during the Second World War. To this day, the city is still full of legends, fairy tales, and even mysticism. They give this place a unique charm. The brilliant Ernst Hoffmann and the modern children's writer Paul Maar wrote their fairy tales here. Beautiful landscapes, authentic character, and some higher callings that faithfully protect the city fill Bamberg with a magical atmosphere."

In 121, the settlement became the center of the province and received all the rights of a Roman city. Its favorable geographical location at the crossroads of trade routes contributed to rapid economic development.\n        <p>During the medieval period, it became the largest commercial center of Bavaria. A great contribution to the prosperity of his native city was made by Jakob Fugger, a merchant from a family of weavers, who, in the XVI century, became the wealthiest man on the planet thanks to his intelligence and diligence. Goods produced by local merchants and artisans were shipped all over the world with the help of his ships. Thanks to him, the concept of social housing was born when he built an entire block (Fuggerei) of 53 low-income housing units in Augsburg. Each of these was to be occupied for only one guilder (currently 80 euro cents) per year. The quarter is still operating today, and the living conditions have not changed.</p><p>The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a great disaster for the city. Its population almost halved, and its political and economic importance was severely diminished. Augsburg lost its liberal imperial town status during the Napoleonic war and was annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria on March 4, 1806.</p><p>At that time, there were facilities like the M.A.N. tank factory, Messerschmitt aircraft factory, and various repair shops. During World War II, this industrial center of Germany was mercilessly bombed by the anti-Hitler coalition aircraft. Most of the architectural treasures of the city were destroyed. It took over a decade to restore at least part of the lost.</p><p>Since the second half of the twentieth century, Augsburg has been gaining ground again as an important industrial center in Bavaria. Today it is home to the world's manufacturing giants (Siemens, KUKA, M.A.N., N.C.R., the EADS airplane manufacturer) and a number of food and light industry companies. And it does not prevent Augsburg from being an extremely beautiful old town with excellent tourist infrastructure. In 2000, it was recognized by UNESCO as the greenest city in Europe and was rewarded for its environmental commitment.</p>"

Besides, the merchant is wealthy, rouge, and hospitable! This place will be right for those who appreciate good food, cozy streets, and authentic buildings. There is no entertainment \"just for tourists.\" You can see the monuments just while walking around the city. And the local citizens will gladly come to the Freimarkt, which is considered to be the oldest fair in all of Germany and is held in October. If you describe Bremen in three words, it is authenticity, energy, and comfort. And yes, you will undoubtedly find a monument to the renowned musicians here!"

Over the next few centuries, the city was repeatedly conquered. It took turns owned by the Carthaginians and the Romans. Under the Romans, it was already called Gades. It was granted municipal rights by the young Gaius Julius Caesar. The city has seen the Vandals, Visigoths, Arabs, Greeks, and Byzantines. In the 1280s, Cadiz (then already had a modern name) appeared in the first Spanish chronicle of King Alfonso X.\n        <p>During the Age of Discovery, the city and the ports nearby were strategically important to Europeans discovering new routes and lands. Spanish expeditions to the Americas departed from here, and Columbus' ships sailed in search of the lands of the New World.</p><p>In 1810-1812, Cadiz was unsuccessfully besieged by the French. At the same time, the city's population grew considerably at the expense of Spanish refugees who saw this vacant place as a safe haven. Members of the Cortes came here to debate the nuances of Europe's first constitution. On March 19, 1812, it was adopted and became the first constitution of Spain. It established a constitutional monarchy: the legislative power was vested in the Cortes and the king, and the executive power was in the king alone.</p><p>Eight years later, the city was dragged into a revolution provoked by the lack of promised reforms. King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned in the castle of Cadiz. Three years later, he was released and made new promises, which he again broke. As a result, the constitution was abolished. The \"black decade\" began with repression and terror. Naturally, this attitude towards the people caused a new wave of discontent and a new revolution, which ended with the formation of a new government headed by Jose Concha.</p><p>Up to the beginning of the twentieth century, Cadiz survived mainly as a port through shipbuilding and trading activities. But the well-being of the citizens, alas, did not grow until the development of tourism. Tourism was the impetus for constructing a streetcar line and hotels and expanding the port quays to accommodate cruise ships.</p><p>On August 18, 1947, an explosion in the armories of Cadiz took the lives of 5 thousand citizens and severely damaged some of the city's buildings. The Cathedral and the Falla Theater were among those destroyed. Within a few years, the major damage was repaired.</p><p>Today, the province of Cadiz, with its rich history and many historical monuments, is a popular tourist destination. Millions of travelers come here every year.</p>"

A little later, they were replaced by the Romans and Greeks, later displaced by the Moors. Benidorm received the City Charter in 1325, becoming part of the possessions of the King of Aragon - James II the Just.\n        <p>In the 16th century, pirate raids on the coast became more frequent. The city built a fortress and several towers on the cliffs, allowing time to notice the enemy fleet and prepare for defense. Nevertheless, Benidorm often suffered from the attacks of sea robbers. This greatly hampered trade and prevented the locals from fishing.</p><p>This state of affairs continued until the 19th century. In the period from 1802 to 1812, the coast was occupied by Napoleon's troops, but the city did not suffer much, in contrast to the population robbed by the soldiers. After the defeat of the French, smugglers and pirates began to return to Benidorm, but King Fernando VII of Spain sent a separate fleet to fight them and restore order there.</p><p>At the end of the XIX century, the first vacationers from Madrid appeared in the town, but the further tourist development of the city was stopped first by the Civil and then the Second World War. The real resort of Benidorm became only in the 70s of the XX century when its beaches attracted tourists from all over the world, attracted by the uniquely mild climate of the region.&nbsp;</p><p>Legend has it that an extravagant publicity campaign, organized at his own expense by Pedro Zaragoza, then mayor of the city, contributed greatly to this. He paid a family of reindeer herders - they rode together through the major airports of Spain with a sign that read, \"This northern family is coming to rest on the coast of Benidorm.\" Word of this quickly spread throughout Europe, and the influx of tourists gradually increased. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but Pedro Zaragoza really did a lot for the prosperity of his city. For example, he created a master plan for the town, changing the previous concept in favor of vertical buildings and creating wide avenues. It was also through his efforts that he created the water system and ensured its uninterrupted operation.</p>"

Historians have quite detailed information about the building thanks to the Calixtinus Codex.

Further, the territory was conquered many times. In 192 BC, Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior founded here his outpost and named it Toletum. In 411, the nomadic tribe (the Alans) settled in this small village. Seven years later, an early Germanic tribe of the Visigoths located on the territory and made Toletum their capital. In this status, it lasted till 711.\n        <p>In 712, the Moors conquered the territory. After the Visigoths\u2019 banishment, the Moors renamed Toletum into \u1e6culay\u1e6dulah. But in 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile oppressed these lands and located the residence of the Castilian kings. Once, the Muslim city \u1e6culay\u1e6dulah became the Christian Toledo. The residence occupied the place for 5 centuries, until 1561, when Philip II of Spain removed his possessions to Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p>During the wars on the Iberian peninsula (the Reconquista epoch), Toledo was the capital of Spain and carried a name of the City of the Three Cultures.

The ancient Italian city lies on a high Tuscan hill, 120 kilometers from Florence, and 180 kilometers from Rome. Arriving here, tourists know that you can try the original Italian red wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, which has been produced since the 17th century. It is clear that for a wine, you need a great snack, and here it is in abundance. Fine Pecorino cheese (Pecorino Romano) is another Montepulciano trademark. You should definitely order this cheese at the local restaurants. The best kinds are produced in medieval mansions, and there are a lot of them. No coincidence, director Chris Weitz chose the views of this city as the scenery for the adaptation of New Moon, the second book of The Twilight Saga by Stephenie Meyer. Beautiful palaces and cathedrals of the Renaissance period, built during the Medici time, as if inviting to plunge into the sea of the architectural charm of southern Tuscany. Against the backdrop of the picturesque hills and narrow streets of the Italian chamber town, they look even stricter and more beautiful."

Many city residents are happy to identify themselves as descendants of the Etruscans. However, archaeological research has disproved the connection between this branch of civilization and the Italians. However, already in those early days, there were vineyards and thermal springs.\n        <p>In 568, together with other Italian lands, it was conquered by the Lombards. The ancient Germanic tribe founded the Lombard state, whose center was located on the territory of modern Lombardy. Montepulciano served as a defensive fortress against barbarian raids for a long time. For this purpose, defensive structures were built there.</p><p>Since the twelfth century, Montepulciano had been conquered by the Republic of Siena, which had established itself in the southern part of Tuscany. To seriously oppose these attempts, 200 years later, the city joined Florence in an alliance with it. In 1511, at the behest of the Medici dukes, the disputed territory on the hill was surrounded by high and thick walls. Together, Siena's claims were repulsed.</p><p>The main temples and sumptuous palaces from the XVI century were built in Montepulciano. Many of the buildings belonged to the famous Florentine architect Giuliano da Sangallo and his relatives, who worked on behalf of Lorenzo de' Medici. Most of these medieval architectural gems are still preserved in Montepulciano today. It is worth coming here just to see them.</p><p>By the end of the XVI century, Siena was annexed to the Duchy of Florence. The former importance of Montepulciano as a defensive point was lost. Since then, the city has led a measured existence based on wine production and the development of the food industry. It has become, in fact, a resort where wealthy nobles go to rest or settle permanently.</p><p>Today, tens of thousands of tourists visit Montepulciano every year. They are attracted by the unique atmosphere created by the ancient monuments, surrounded by picturesque hills, and maintained by the hospitable people of the town.</p>"

This small cozy town absolutely coincides with the idea of the traditional image of Italy. Moreover, it makes it more expressive and distinct. Without a provincial town as vintage as Bergamo, Italy's character would be imperfect. It is like the missing piece in the puzzle that connects all the other parts together: once it takes its place, a beautiful picture emerges. It is composed of many puzzles in unique and slightly motley integrity! And at the same time, you can confidently say that such an Italy, with the taste of bergamot and the majesty of the mountains, you have not yet seen! The picturesque Lake Como and the foothill valley of the Alps give a special beauty to the city. Bergamo breathes freshness with retrospectives into the past, as UNESCO fully protects the town. For so many centuries, the paradox of Bergamo is that with so many authentic sights, it remains a little-known city.

Around this time, Duke Andrea Matteo III of the Acquaviva dynasty brought his peasants here. They began cultivating the land and settling in a new place, but the local areas were subject to special laws. The feudal lord had to pay a tax to settle on the land belonging to the King of Naples, but Andrea Matteo III did not want to do that.\n        <p>To solve the tax problem, the duke ordered the peasants to build special stone houses called trulli. Their main feature was the presence of stone, which was laid in the base. It was enough to remove this stone that the house crumbled in a moment. Thus, when the duke learned that the royal tax collectors were approaching, the houses in the settlement were quickly destroyed. In this case, it was not necessary to pay taxes, but the peasants had to rebuild their homes anew each time.</p><p>In 1797, King Ferdinand of the Bourbon dynasty tried to change the situation and granted Alberobello freedom. However, frightened peasants continued to build trulli; only a few people ventured to build new houses with entrenchment. Classic trulli with a domed roof appeared in Alberobello until 1925, until the Italian authorities issued a law according to which it was forbidden to erect such structures. In this case, it was possible to repair old houses, but it was not possible to build new ones.</p><p>The official abolition of the trulli tax dates back to 1979. Since then, all such houses have been privately owned, and the city has gained fame as one of the most unusual in Italy, which attracts many tourists. Since 1996, Alberobello has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>"

It is only known that the Roman Empire established its colonies throughout the Padan Plain, including Ravenna, in the II century BC.\n\nThe Romans built here the port of Classe, a powerful trading and military point for the entire Mediterranean. However, over the years, the coastline of the Adriatic Sea moved away. The process of silting contributed to the flow of the river Po (today, the city is 10 km from the Adriatic, and the sea is connected only by an artificial canal).\n        <p>During the millennial history of its existence, Ravenna has been the capital of the different states three times. The ruler of the Western Roman Empire, Honorius, gave the city that status in 402. Together with his sister Galla Placidia, he established the imperial residence here. During this period, the whole of Italy suffered from the Great Migration of Peoples, while Ravenna was rapidly developing economically and culturally.</p><p>A new page in the history of the city began on September 2, 476. Then Odoacer dethroned the last emperor of the Roman Empire, Romulus. The leader of the Germanic tribes took these lands under his rule. Odoacer declared himself the leader of the Kingdom of Italy, in which Ravenna became the capital.</p><p>Ravenna remained the main city during the rule of the King of the Ostrogoths, Theodoric the Great. After a long siege in 493, the power was in his hands. Ravenna experienced another round of development during the reign of Theodoric.</p><p>After half a century, Ravenna was part of Byzantium for the next 200 years. During this period, Christianity flourished here; the city experienced its third wave of prosperity.</p><p>Ravenna was subjected to the Lombard Kingdom, the Venetian Empire, and the Papal States in the following years.</p><p>At the beginning of the XVII century, the sea flooded the city. Irrigation methods were used to restore Ravenna to its former state.</p><p>Since the XIX century, it has been a richly developed city in united Italy.</p>"

Later, Emperor Trajan recognized the importance of the port in Ancona. It was very convenient for the Empire to trade with Dalmatia. Therefore the port was enlarged and fortified.\n        And the city itself, thanks to the lively trade, began to grow rapidly.\n\n<p>In 774, Ancona joined the Papal States and remained part of them until 1100. Later it was declared an independent republic. This event provoked the aggression of the neighbors - no one wanted to miss the opportunity to take possession of such a large trading port. The city had to repel the attacks of the Venetian Republic, the Holy See, and the German emperors one by one. The last siege of 1173-1174 was especially bloody. During this period, the Archbishop of Mainz, a legate of Emperor Barbarossa, tried to conquer Ancona.</p><p>In 1532, power over the city again passed into the hands of the Vatican.

Furthermore, the resort is situated in the administrative region of Calabria, in the province of Catanzaro, between the Ionian and Tyrrhenian (Mediterranean) seas. If Italy is represented in the shape of a boot, then Lamezia Terme is its front part. In turn, the Amato River and the Apennine Range form a heterogeneous landscape of the city. Nowadays, Lamezia Terme is widely known due to picturesque corners of nature with sand dunes and rocky landscapes; hills and plains; clean sea air with the aroma of oranges and rosemary; magnificent churches and museums; the ruins of ancient medieval castles and fortresses. At the same time, hot mineral springs are considered an essential part of this town. The thermal procedures are more effective when they are carried out in a beautiful historical place with the modern benefits of civilization. In other words, people have the opportunity to escape from the noisy bustle of megalopolises, get health benefits, and enjoy peace in the traditional Italian atmosphere in Lamezia Terme. This is a corner of Italy, which has not become tremendously popular yet."

Because of the constant attacks of the Germanic tribes, the Roman legionaries left the fortress in the III century.\n        <p>In the first half of the VII century, by order of the Frankish king Dagobert I, a church was built in Traiectum.

In the last years of the VII century, the bishop's chair appeared here and became the center of spreading Christianity in the surrounding areas.</p><p>At the beginning of the XII century, Traiectum received the status of a city and its new name, Utrecht. It is translated from Old Dutch as \"the crossing of the lowland river\". The river referred to the Rhine.</p><p>In the middle of the XVI century, the city came into the possession of Charles V of Habsburg, the Roman emperor. Then the lands of the Netherlands and Utrecht itself passed to his son, the Spanish King Philip II. This led to the establishment of Spanish rule.</p><p>The population was dissatisfied with Spanish rule, and the struggle for independence at the end of the XVI century resulted in the proclamation of the sovereignty of the Netherlands.

In 1308, the Teutonic Knights conquered Gdansk and built a fortress here. They renamed the city Danzig.\n\nIn 1466, after the defeat of the Teutonic Order, the city returned to the Polish lands and regained its former name, Gdansk. At the same time, it received great privileges from the Polish king. The city minted its own coins and elected its own officials.\n        <p>Its belonging to the merchant union of Hansa towns (1361-1669) was of great importance for the city's development, both under the Teutonic domination and during its being a part of Poland. Gda\u0144sk played one of the leading roles in the Hanseatic League. In the XVI century, it became the biggest city in Poland and one of the biggest centers of European trade.</p><p>At the end of the XIX century, after the partition of Poland, Gdansk is part of Prussia. However, in 1807, Napoleon revived Poland and declared Gdansk a free city. But in 1815, Bonaparte suffered a final defeat, and Prussia got the city again.</p><p>After World War I, under the Treaty of Versailles, Danzig once again received the status of a free city, but under the general patronage of the League of Nations and Poland. But the majority of the city's population was German.</p><p>On September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland. And the war began here. A small Polish garrison heroically resisted the superior enemy forces for almost 150 hours near Gdansk (Danzig), on the Westerplatte Peninsula. The city was cleared of the Nazis in March 1945 by Soviet troops, but up to 80% of the buildings in the center of Gdansk were destroyed during the war.</p><p>Reconstruction of the city began as early as the late 1940s. Buildings of historical value were reconstructed. New buildings were erected instead of the ruins in the city center, in the style of Dutch mannerism, typical for the XVIII-century Gdansk. The imitation of the old times concerned only the facades, while the interiors contained entirely modern apartments.</p><p>Many famous people have lived and worked in Gda\u0144sk, such as Johannes Hevelius (an astronomer and creator of astronomical instruments), Martin Opitz (a theorist of German poetics), Daniel Fahrenheit (a physicist who developed the temperature scale later named after him).

After 300 years, it became the property of Rome and rapidly developed because of its favorable location.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the town was renamed Antibulus. In 442, a bishopric was founded there. But the constant raids of the Saracens, Visigoths, and barbarians gradually ruined it. Even the formidable castle and the fortress walls erected around Antibulus did not save it. This forced Pope Innocent IV in 1243 to transfer the bishop's throne to Grasse.\n        <p>From 1385 to 1608, the Grimaldi family ruled the city. They rebuilt and enlarged the castle to its present size. In 1482, Provence became part of the Kingdom of France and Antibes became a border town.</p><p>In the XVII century, on the orders of Louis XIV, its fortifications were modernized. This enabled it to withstand a 58-day siege by Austrian, Sardinian, and English troops in the winter of 1747.</p><p>In 1815, Napoleon was not favored here. For his loyalty, King Louis XVIII returned to the city the title \"Bon Ville,\" which had previously been revoked by the Emperor. Antibes also received a new coat of arms depicting the Fleur-de-Lis.</p><p>In the mid-XIX century, the beauty of nature attracted the wealthy nobility here. Luxury villas and residences began to appear in the city. In 1870 the first luxurious hotel was built. And in 1887, Stephen Liegeard made the French Riviera famous in his novel \"The Cote d'Azur .\"Over the next six years, two more luxury hotels opened in the new resort area of Juan-les-Pins. After that, wealthy people from all over the world began to flock to Antibes. It took its place between Nice and Cannes in a series of magnificent seaside resorts. By 1895 the town had grown so big that the protective walls had become \"too small\" for it, and the authorities began to tear them down. Tourism took an important place in the priorities of the city's economy.</p><p>The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are a special era for Antibes. During this period, the most fashionable and popular artists of the day come here - artists, musicians, actors, poets, and writers. Here is where Francis Scott Fitzgerald created the novel \"A Gentle Night .\"The prototype of the hotel described in it still exists today under the name \"Hotel du Cap-Eden-Rock .\"And the stars of the XXI century are still happy to stay there.</p><p>World War II briefly interrupted the idyllic development of events. But as soon as it ended, Antibes once again became a place of attraction for the American and European creative elite. Pablo Picasso lived here for six months. A part of the Grimaldi castle was allocated for his studio. In gratitude, the artist left an impressive collection of works as a gift to the city.</p><p>In 1960, the first jazz festival in Europe was held in Juan-les-Pins. And ten years later, Marineland was opened. It is a very large entertainment marine park and research center. In 1970-1984, a project was implemented to create a technology park, Sophia Antipolis, northwest of the resort. It is the French version of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Today Antibes is the largest yacht port and a trendy tourist center of the Cote d'Azur. It is also called the most popular youth resort on the Riviera.</p>"

Many museums, cathedrals, and unique architectural structures are well-suited for leisurely walking and exploring the city's culture. In order to connect with nature, it is recommended to find incredible panoramic views on the shores of Lake Geneva."

Rather quickly, its population grew to 1500. A theater was built in the outlying areas, and wealthier homeowners settled on the hillsides opposite the lake. After two centuries of prosperity, the Roman world collapsed, and most of the population left the area.\n        <p>At the end of the VI century, the town became an Episcopal center and gradually expanded.

In 1481 municipal autonomy was introduced, and an alliance with Fribourg and Bern was soon signed. Lausanne lost its political importance, becoming a provincial town.</p><p>At the end of the XVI-mid XVII centuries, the city was plagued by witch hunts. By the early XVIII century, there was a rebellion to free it from the Bern authorities. But it was quickly suppressed.</p><p>At the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Republic of Lehman was proclaimed.

The population rates declined during wars and epidemics and then increased again.\n        <p>Modern Stockholm is a huge metropolis, which in combination with the communes, totals 962,154 residents of the city as of January 1, 2019.</p>"

The architecture of its cities and towns amazes with a unique mixture of many styles. In turn, nature captivates with its beauty and generosity of solar heat, whereas the coast of the island is washed by two seas. The residents of this island are surprisingly open-minded and friendly. These people love music, which is why they often sing cantadedes (funny songs created by locals). By the way, it was on this island that the oldest philharmonic society in Greece was founded. For quite a long time, the vacation on Corfu has been considered a privilege of aristocrats and representatives of Bohemia. However, today, the cleanest sandy beaches, cozy bays, and green cliffs are accessible to everyone. Corfu is always waiting for guests who want to enjoy this unique corner of nature."

It is known that from the VIII century B.C., the place was ruled by the valiant Spartans. During the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, Kalamata was not economically developed and was of little strategic interest to the city-states.\n        <p>The changes in the life of the city began in the 13th century and were associated with the Fourth Crusade. From this period, Kalamata belonged to the Franks. The construction of the fortifications also led to the city's economic development.</p><p>The rich and generous land of Kalamata now beckoned more and more conquerors. In 1459, the city fell under the rule of the Serene Republic of Venice. And three centuries later, the conquerors appeared here again - Kalamata became part of the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>The year 1821 was marked as the year of the city's liberation from the Turks. In Kalamata, rebellions against Ottoman domination broke out. Soon the wave of liberation swept across Greece. And in 1829, Turkey had to recognize the independence of this country. Kalamata was at the origin of the Greek Revolution for Freedom.</p><p>At the end of the XIX century, the town began to build a port. This contributed to the rapid development of Kalamata. Although it is not strategically important for the country, it is the second most important polis in the Peloponnese Peninsula today. The export of olives has already become a trademark of the city. And the fame of a quiet tourist spot with top-notch beaches gradually attracts more and more travelers worldwide.</p>"

Also, the city is famous for its crystal products which have been produced here since the end of the 18th century. Waterford is the oldest city in the country, which was founded by the Vikings back in 914. And today it attracts tourists with its historical monuments, museums and parks. Firstly, a tourist should visit the Viking Triangle \u2014 the old part of the city, enclosed by a wall of the 10th century. The inherent Viking settlement was situated on its borders. At one of the Triangle Sites stands the Reginald\u2019s Tower, constructed with the wall. Now there is one of the three city historical museums. You should also visit the Medieval Museum and the Bishop's Palace Museum. Other places of interest include Christ Church Cathedral, Municipal Art Gallery, The Theatre Royal, and John Roberts Square. You can also take a tour of Waterford Crystal. And about 14 kilometers from Waterford, in Kilmeadan, there is a beautiful Mount Congreve botanical garden."

Many tourists, having once visited this cozy and green city, want to return here again and again to plunge into the atmosphere of its ancient, cobblestone streets, to admire the abundance of architectural styles of buildings and numerous churches, to feel the magical aura of the city, described by Max Fry in \"Tales of Old Vilnius.\" Here you will find a harmonious combination of old buildings with new structures of modern architecture. In some places, you can see the houses left from the Soviet times. By the way, they, as well as other buildings of the capital at that time, became the \"heroes\" of the famous series \"Chernobyl.\" Most of the filming took place in Vilnius, and it has added to its popularity. Every year, more than a million tourists visit this clean, quiet, friendly, and multinational city. Old Vilnius has many mysteries, which can hardly be discovered in one trip. It's worth coming here at any time of year."

At the beginning of the II century AD, the Romans built a fort to house their legion, named Napoca, on the site of the future city. After its destruction, the new town was founded in 1213, and Transylvania fell under Hungarian rule. They renamed the Kolozsv\u00e1r town, and after Hungary became part of the Habsburg Empire, it was renamed Klausenburg. In Cluj-Napoca, it is worth seeing the architectural ensemble of the main town square of Unification, with the famous Gothic St. Michael's Church of the XIV-XV centuries, a monument to the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus, the Museum of Pharmacy in the building of the oldest pharmacy in the city, founded in 1573. It is interesting to visit the National Museum of Art, also known as Banffy Palace in the Baroque style, and see the panorama of the city from Castle Hill."

The overwhelming majority of the local citizens (95%) consider themselves to be Chinese. The remaining 5% are immigrants from Asian countries, Europe, and even North America. As a rule, representatives of different nationalities form ethnic communities and live within the boundaries of one district.</p><p>A trip to new countries and cities is not only about bright emotions, but also a little stressful because you have to learn to navigate in a completely different world. We prepared a list of useful recommendation to help the people who head to Hong Kong:</p><ul><li>Since 2009, there is a strict law in Hong Kong that forbids smoking in public places: restaurants and cafes, public transport stops, and even in lavatories. Public appearance with a cigarette makes yourself liable to a serious fine. There are specially equipped zones for smokers.</li><li>You can and even should bargain in shops and markets in Hong Kong unless these are big shopping centers. When you buy some goods, and the price is set for weight, you should pay attention to the units used. The thing is that they often use zin and catty in China instead of a kilogram. They stand for 0.5 and 0.6 kg, respectively.</li><li>The majority of cafes in Hong Kong offer their menus in Chinese only. It's hard to gain an understanding, so one should start their acquaintance with local cuisine with fast food. Almost all establishments have long lines. You can grab a quick snack only in some restaurants. If you want to save money, you should order sets and not every dish separately. Another piece of advice concerns flatware. As a rule, guests are given only chopsticks with their order. So, if you are not sure about your skills, you should bring a plastic fork with you.</li><li>The best way to save your budget during a trip to Hong Kong is to purchase a special adVenture Card. You can buy it on the official website. This card allows you to visit 15 sights for free or with up to 50% discount. The venture program also includes rides on a cableway, a tour bus, and a trip to Macau.</li><li>Hong Kong has left-hand traffic. This rule concerns drivers, pedestrians in the streets, metro, underground passages. So, before you cross a street, first look right, and only then \u2014 left.</li></ul>"

Here, the Klang and Gombak rivers merge and flow into the Strait of Malacca. The Petronas Twin Towers are regarded as the main symbols of the city, as they rise above the urban landscape. This is a city of contrasts, where different people, languages, \u200b\u200band religions intertwine together. Additionally, it is here that the economic and cultural life is concentrated. At the same time, evergreen forests, hilly terrain, and equatorial beaches with white and golden sand, washed by the warm waters of the Strait of Malacca, will surprise the most sophisticated connoisseur of exotic relaxation."

The first \"big\" group of tourists, 100 people, visited Jeju-do in 1958. And 13 years later, Newsweek magazine already wrote about it as \"the island of the Gods.

The rapid transformation of Kamakura into the informal capital of Japan was facilitated by the usual for that time feuds. In the XII century, the greatest power in the country belonged to the Taira clan. At one point, its leader even managed to make his three-year-old grandson an emperor. Eventually, however, the Taira lost the power contest to the Minamoto clan, who put their candidate on the throne.\n        The head of the clan, Yoritomo Minamoto, received the title of shogun (\"barbarian-quelling generalissimo,\" a military ruler) from the new emperor. He decided it was wiser to place his administration away from the imperial palace in Kyoto. He created a bakufu (or shogunate, literally, \"tent government\"), a field headquarters, on his land (in Kamakura). Thus, in 1192, the small village became the center of political life in Japan, and the \"Kamakura period\" appeared in history.\n\n<p>In its heyday, the town was the largest in the country, with about 10,000 houses. One by one, Buddhist temples were built. Trade was booming, and blacksmithing was developing. The properties and quality of samurai tools of the XII-XIII centuries are still valued today. Masamune, from the province of Sagami, was the most famous blacksmith of this period.</p><p>The city's decline was as rapid as its rise. In 1274 and 1281, Japan survived invasions by the Mongol-Chinese forces of Kublai Khan. The country survived, but its economy was badly damaged. At the same time, the influence of the bakufu military administration was shaken - it simply lacked money.</p><p>In 1333 the Kamakura shogunate fell to the Ashikaga clan. Following this, Kamakura lost its status as a political center forever and once again became a small village. At the same time, the city's religious significance, thanks to its numerous temples, diminished only slightly.</p><p>After the Meiji restoration in 1868, life in Kamakura revived as the country began to show interest in ancient Japan's history and spiritual heritage.</p><p>In 1923, Kamakura, like many other cities on the east coast of Honshu, was thoroughly destroyed in a monstrous earthquake. But it was quickly rebuilt.</p><p>American air raids during World War II, fortunately, bypassed it. During the entire subsequent period, the city actively developed, and thanks to the surviving historical monuments, it became a popular tourist center.</p>"

In order to develop trade relations with Europe, he converted to Christianity and founded port settlements, including Nagasaki.\n\nIn 1570, it was equipped with a port, and in 1571 a settlement grew there. Thanks to active trade, the city quickly developed and became one of the richest in Japan.\n        <p>In 1715, the growth of economy of Nagasaki went into decline. The reason was the establishment of government limits on the importation of goods. But despite this, the city remained the center of education in Japan. They studied foreign languages, science, and European medicine here.</p><p>At the beginning of the XIX century, the local port was declared open for ships of foreign states such as Russia, Great Britain, the United States, and others. This contributed to the modernization of Nagasaki. Later, the first Japanese railroad, an English-language newspaper, and a telegraph appeared here. Thanks to the activities of Western embassies, the country was able to lift the ban on Christianity, which had lasted about two hundred years. Most of the people of Nagasaki were able to return to the Church openly.</p><p>The most famous tragedy in the city's history was the atomic bombing on August 9, 1945. Most of Nagasaki was destroyed, and the terrible explosion took the lives of about 70 thousand people. The city was located in a hilly area, so there was less destruction than in Hiroshima. Over time, numerous museums and memorials were built in its territory to commemorate the victims of the atomic bombing \u2014 the Peace Statue, the Atomic Bomb Museum, and the Peace Park were created.</p>"

The fact is that the Canaanites dyed the fabrics with a unique composition, which was made from the slime of local shells of the Murex genus. That's why this product was in great demand.\n        <p>The Canaanite settlement existed for about 500 years, and in the XV century B.C., it came under the authority of the Egyptian pharaohs. After 300 years, the Philistines from Greece took over the territory. Ashdod was their major city. These ancient people lived here until the VI century B.C. Then the city repeatedly changed hands. Both Assyrians and Persians visited it. In the IV century B.C., the area was conquered by Alexander of Macedon, who founded a Greek city on it.</p><p>In 147 BC, Ashdod was taken and attached to Judea during the Jewish revolt against the Ptolemaic Empire. The Romans, led by commander Pompey, conquered the area in the I century B.C. During their rule, Ashdod became an important port city.</p><p>In 66 A.D., during the Roman-Jewish collision, Ashdod was destroyed and, after that, lost its importance and remained a small settlement for about a thousand years.</p><p>In the IX-X centuries, a small Arab town, Isdud, was founded there.

The owners of the East India Company earned a lot from the export of perfumes, muslin, silk, and ivory products for which the city was famous.</p><p>Only in the early XX century did the kingdom of Kashi gain independence and become an Indian state, but without jurisdiction over Varanasi.</p><p>Now the city is one of the largest religious centers in India.

The decision to divide Bengal, however, provoked widespread discontent.</p><p>The situation in the city gradually heated up, and the British relocated the capital to Delhi in 1911.

Its streets, where hundreds of thousands of people have lived and often died, turned the city into a symbol of poverty and decay. The new wave of refugees that swept in after the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war exacerbated the situation.</p><p>In 2001, Calcutta officially became Kolkata.</p><p>Now the state capital of West Bengal has overcome a long depression, and its economy is one of the fastest-growing in India.</p>"

Yes, some of the free beaches are not impressive because they are visited by residents (and Aqaba has 140,000 inhabitants). But there are also more than enough comfortable beaches. And the \"Tala Bay\" complex, located on the southern outskirts of the city, will satisfy the most demanding fans of beach recreation.

In other words, you can not cool down from the day's heat in the sea, and the hot wind does not bring freshness.

It was then inhabited by various tribes of North American Indians who did not build cities but wandered after moving flocks of bison. The first settlement on this site was Fort Brisebois, founded in 1875. There was a unit of mounted police controlling the fur-trade and whiskey trade.\n\nA year later, the fort was renamed to Calgary by Colonel James Macleod. There are several versions of its origins, but the most plausible is that in Gaelic, the expression cala gheallaidh means \"pasture on the shore\", and McLeod was undoubtedly Scottish.\n        <p>In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railroad station was opened in Calgary, and the development of the fort, which quickly became a city, went at a rapid pace. The government began renting out numerous pastures for a symbolic fee, and Calgary became one of the country's largest cattle breeding and agricultural centers. In addition, until 1914, all the settlers had been given free plots of land for building houses, which had rapidly increased the population of the city.</p><p>Oil was first discovered in Calgary in 1902, but there was little of it and did not have much impact on the economy. But in 1947, a geological exploration came across huge deposits, which later gave a powerful boost to the city's economy (in 1973, the oil crisis sharply increased the price of \"black gold\"). The oil boom allowed the start of the construction of numerous skyscrapers that flooded the business center of Calgary, pushing out the classic sandstone buildings. The sharp drop in oil prices put the Calgary economy in a deplorable state, but the situation gradually stabilized and returned to normal by 1990.</p><p>Calgary became a large multinational center, and hosting the Winter Olympics in 1988 brought it worldwide fame. Nowadays, high-tech industries and large investments in tourism contribute to its development. Every year, more than three million tourists come to the city to relax at ski resorts, walk around the city, and participate in cultural events, which are held here quite often. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Calgary has become the 5th most comfortable city in the world, so the visitors feel free and comfortable here.</p>"

Such assumptions are based on the fact that the first mention of the area can be found in the records of the conquistador Juan Diaz (1518). The city ruins were described in detail in 1843. It was done by the travelers John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood in the book \"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan\".\n        <p>In ancient times, Tulum was the only seaport for representatives of the civilization through which the Mayans exported cotton, rubber, and salt to Guatemala. This fact helped the city to avoid the decline of nearby settlements when the Spanish conquerors landed in Yucatan (1517). In contrast, the beginning of the XVI century is considered to be the time of flourishing for Tulum. Remaining a maritime fortress, it became a major trading center on the Caribbean coast. All trade by sea, from Yucatan to Honduras, was conducted through it.</p><p>The exploration of the territory was continued between 1913 and 1924 by the American archaeologist Sylvanus Morley and scientists from the Carnegie Institution for Science. They confirmed that the emergence of the city should be attributed to the year 1200. At the same time, according to them, Tulum stopped to exist after the XVI century.</p><p>Thus, there is a real ancient city in front of us, as if it was frozen more than 400 years ago. With untouched nature and clean beaches right by the Caribbean Sea. This fact has allowed developing Tulum as a popular resort. Today, recreation here has all the advantages one can dream of.</p>"

Meanwhile, Europeans discovered the settlement only in 1542, when the Spanish explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area. For the first time to enter the lands of Tijuana became possible in 1769. That lucky man was the Spanish priest and friar of the Franciscan Order Jun\u00edpero Serra.\n        <p>The new history of Tijuana began in 1846, when as a result of negotiations during the Mexican-American War, Tijuana gained the international border. The city became a borderline, and in 1864 got its own council and judicial body. The date of the official foundation of the city was July 11, 1889.</p><p>According to data within 1900, only 242 citizens lived in the city. The situation rapidly changed in the 20th of the 20 century, when the gambling industry started to develop in Tijuana. The first race track and club were built in 1924, then a tourist center in 1927, and the first casino in 1928.</p><p>On October 15th, 1925, Tijuana became the administrative center of the Zaragoza municipality. However, the new name was not established, so in 1927 the Congress of the Union reverted it to Tijuana. In 1952, Baja California received the status of a free Mexican state, and beginning from May 1st, 1954, Tijuana city administration started to work for the first time.</p><p>Today, Tijuana is considered one of the fastest growing towns in Mexico. People, attracted to gambling and freedom, usually move here. The other newcomers are the citizens, who wanted to move to America, but didn\u2019t have enough grounds, and were forced to settle in Tijuana. As a result, the city has earned a bad reputation.</p><p>Every year, current authorities are actively dealing with the bad image, and gradually turning Tijuana into an interesting and touristic center.</p>"

At the time, it was the longest wooden bridge in the world, as well as an important road to provide the urban development project with all the necessary resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Collins sold the land and invested the revenue in the sand and washing up the island. That's how more territory for sale appeared. At this time, Carl Fisher organized a major hotel construction. Hotels and restaurants for the wealthy began to appear in Miami Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1930s, the city became the winter residence of many mafia members from New York and Chicago, including the famous Al Capone.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 80s, South Beach was a terrible place. Tourists did not show up south of 41st Street at all. Rats were running everywhere, and half the houses were abandoned.&nbsp;</p><p>Things started to change in the 90s. The money gained from selling drugs began to be reinvested in construction. In 20 years, Miami Beach experienced a real rebuilding boom. Whole streets of skyscrapers with magnificent ocean views grew up here. Another factor in the development was the appearance of famous models and actors from around the world in the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Miami Beach remains the most popular resort for rich and famous people.</p>"

After 6 days, the pirates retreated under the onslaught of Spanish soldiers and never returned here.</p><p>Monterey became part of the United States in 1846, after the end of the Mexican-American War. This event is considered an important milestone on the path of the accession of the entire state to the United States. Like other cities on this coast, Monterey existed exclusively thanks to fishing, which gradually equated this city with others and led to the loss of the status of the capital.</p><p>During World War I, sardine processing plants were opened in the city; they were located next to the Old Fisherman's Wharf. These plants formed the main street called Ocean View Ave, which is now considered one of the most interesting attractions of the city.</p><p>In the middle of the last century, fish resources were depleted. In fact, fish catches began to rapidly fall, which ultimately led to the ruin of canneries. Since then, Monterey has become an exclusively tourist resort. Tremendously popular as a clean, complacent, and fabulously beautiful city, it owes its popularity to the novels of the famous American writer John Steinbeck, who described this city in the novels \"Sweet Thursday\" and \"Cannery Row.\"</p>"

The University of California, Santa Cruz, works here. However, real fame and recognition came to the city with 60 thousand inhabitants in 2007. It was at the beginning of August of that year that the owner of one of the local pubs offered to found a new beer festival that would unite the lovers of this foamy beverage all over the world. It was suggested to make this day the International Beer Day. While the first celebration took place only in the Californian city, after some time, it crossed the borders of countries and continents. The beer lovers liked the idea so much that, for example, five years later, the holiday was celebrated in 207 cities in five dozen countries on five continents."

The Indians used these trade routes even before the arrival of European settlers. The city was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III of England.\n        <p>Charlotte received the city statute in 1768 and later became the residence of the county. This was mainly due to the efforts of local residents, who built a courthouse with columns and other public facilities. In May 1775, Charlotte made its declaration of disobedience to Britain. The Mecklenburg Orders of May 31, 1775, declared \"the power of the king or parliament invalid.\"</p><p>The second half of the XVIII century is famous for the prosperity of the inner parts of North Carolina. The discovery of gold nearby led to an increase in settlements in the Charlotte area. Mining activities contributed to the city's development, and the proximity to the mines led to the appearance here in 1837, a branch of the national mint. At the same time, several banks were opened in the city. Before the California Gold Rush of 1849, Charlotte was the center of gold production in the country.</p><p>In the 1850s, Charlotte became the southern end station of the North Carolina railroad. During the Civil War of 1861-1865, thanks to access to the railroad, the city increased the number of important military facilities.</p><p>Charlotte survived the war with dignity. African Americans, who made up 40% of the population of Mecklenburg County, were now free. The population of the city has doubled during the 1860s. A new era began with the civil rights movement in the middle of the XX century.</p><p>At the same time, the first racing tracks began to appear in Charlotte. In 1949, here was held the first-ever race of professional serial cars NASCAR. And ten years later, the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway racing track was built.</p><p>In 1993, a soccer team, Carolina Panthers, was created in Charlotte. In the early 2000s, the city continued its educational and cultural development. In addition, it became a center of professional sports, in particular, car racing.

However, it was soon destroyed when the Spaniards regained power over this land.\n        <p>In 1821, Florida came under US jurisdiction. After that, the settlement became known as Jacksonville. Thus, the inhabitants paid tribute to the first military governor of Florida (and later, the seventh president of America) Andrew Jackson. Jacksonville received the status of the city in 1859. Already at that time, it was a major supplier of cotton and wood, thanks to the most important port in Florida.</p><p>Since the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, the city became a major supplier of meat products to the Confederate troops. During the war, it moved from the south to the north several times and vice versa. In 1864, a major fight took place near it \u2014 a battle near the railway station of Olustee.</p><p>At the end of the confrontation, the city was quite ragged but quickly recovered. From 1867 to 1898, it even was a fashionable winter resort for American families who had enriched themselves during the war. They came here by steamboats and by rail. By the end of the century, the yellow fever epidemic had reduced the influx of tourists. And the railway, which stretched deep into the peninsula, led travelers to new cities.</p><p>In the first year of the XX century, a major fire broke out in Jacksonville. It destroyed the wooden buildings in the center and left 10,000 inhabitants homeless. The restoration of the city lasted 11 years under the direction of Henry Klutho, a famous architect from New York.</p><p>In the second decade of the past century, movie producers became interested in the city. Thirty studios were built here. However, the film boom for Jacksonville passed (as well as tourist boom had) when Hollywood was built.</p><p>Simultaneously with the development of cinematography, Jacksonville was established as a major banking and insurance center. Many companies of national importance thrived here.</p><p>During the Second World War, three large US Navy bases were built in the urban area. They are still prominent employers and a driving force in the development of the city's economy to this day.</p><p>In the XXI century, Jacksonville is a major manufacturing center of America. The economic areas of financing, insurance, biomedicine, information services, ship repair, and loading-unloading are developed here. Tourism is another important source of the city's development. More than 10% of the working residents of the Jacksonville agglomeration are engaged in this sphere. And it's not surprising, because more than three million tourists come here every year.</p>"

Gradually, settlers from the Old World displaced the indigenous inhabitants. The United States acquired the territory of the future Minneapolis in the early XIX century. In 1819, at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, Fort Snelling was founded. Next to it, on the Mississippi's west bank, a small village of Minneapolis grew up in 1854. In 1867, it received the status of a city.\n        <p>In the second half of the XIX century, Minneapolis, located at Saint Anthony Falls and surrounded by dense forests, became the forestry and flour industry's center. This contributed to the development of a wide network of railroads. In the same period, the University of Minnesota was founded in Minneapolis; beautiful park zones were opened, cultural institutions and temples were built.</p><p>After 1930, the industrial decline started in the city. Flour mills began to close gradually. Minneapolis went through the Great Depression and World War II with tremendous pressure.</p><p>In the period from 1963 to 1975, several new major highways passed through its territory. This allowed a significant re-profiling of the city's economy.</p><p>Today Minneapolis is an important transport hub and a popular tourist destination. It produces metal and plastic products, electronics, medical devices, computer equipment, chemicals, cars, spare parts, and has a well-developed retail trade.</p>"

In 1867, this deal was made by the United States Secretary of State, William Seward. At the same time, the arrangement was mainly discussed by journalists and the public in terms of sarcastic ridicule.\n        For instance, it was often called the \u201cSeward freezer,\u201d \u201cSeward\u2019s insanity,\u201d and \u201cSeward\u2019s failure.\u201d In fact, the country was just beginning to recover from the Civil War, the economic downturn, and the reintegration of the states of the South into the United States.\n\n<p>In 1914, to construct the Alaskan Railway, it was decided to erect a tent town called Ship Creek. It grew very quickly; therefore, on November 20, 1920, it was recalled Anchorage. Its economy has long been based on the functioning of the railway. The next major impetus for the development of the city was World War II. Anchorage, with its well-equipped Merrill Field Airport, has become an important strategic center. In turn, it was used to carry out air transport of equipment and military cargo. At the same time, a large Elmendorf Air Force Base was built here.</p><p>In 1964, a powerful 9.2 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska. It almost destroyed Anchorage, depriving it of the majority of the buildings. The city was gradually reconstructed; for example, in 1868, it was discovered the oil field Prudhoe Bay that markedly accelerated the development of the city.</p><p>Today, Anchorage is a modern city where a huge amount of attention is paid not only to tourism but also to the protection of the ecosystem from degradation, as well as the conservation of rare species of northern animals.</p>"

Only in San Jose, you can see tobacco and coffee plantations near the city while being on the hundredth floor of one of the skyscrapers. This capital will surprise tourists not only with beautiful beaches and fascinating sights but also with strange rules. For example, it is forbidden for cars that have number five in their registration plates to show up in the city, and not always, but only on Wednesdays. This fantastic city with exciting people definitely deserves your attention."

A walk along the pier is an excellent opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the ocean. Busselton is located in the south-west of Australia. The distance to the city of Banbury is 52 km, and 229 km to Perth. At the end of the pier is a scientific underwater observatory, from the panoramic windows of which you can see the life of the inhabitants of the ocean. It is also worth seeing the oldest stone temple in the western part of the continent, St. Mary's Church of the middle of the XIX century. You can also visit the Art Complex, which is opened on the premises of a former court, and check out Victoria Park, where the first steam engine of the state, Ballaarat, is installed. Along the coast, there is a 30-km-long beach area."

Earlier, in the first half of the XIX century, the Australian tribes Ngunnawal and Walgalu lived here.\n        <p>The plan for the city was developed by the architectural couple from Chicago, Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin. According to their concept, the basic design of the streets and squares was to be a \"garden city\", where green spaces occupied the majority of the territory. And so it happened. There's so much natural vegetation that the Australians call Canberra their 'Forest Capital'. It's surrounded by nature parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas.</p><p>Up until the Great Depression (world economic crisis of 1929-1939) and World War II, which caught up with it, Canberra had been thriving.

It is called the most colorful city of Polynesia, because it harmoniously combines Asian, European and Polynesian culture. Tourists will not find historical architectural monuments, ancient castles or fortresses, but this is not what attracts millions of travelers every year. Auckland is beautiful, with a large number of modern museums and galleries. All travelers of all ages will be pleased to spend a couple of days here, and many will think about staying here forever."

Another city that, in the opinion of experienced tourists, is similar to Sao Paulo is American Chicago. In fact, it is as huge, colourful, and beautiful as the richest city in Brazil. Perhaps it can be the reason why there are, on average, 10 tourists per 100 residents of Sao Paulo. The majority of them come from Argentina, USA, Spain, and Russia.

They have all reasons for this, because Rio is magnificent, beautiful, authentic, filled with energy and rhythms of hot samba. From the top of Corcovado, 700 meters high, the statue of Christ is watching the city, blessing and protecting it from all troubles. Buildings in neoclassical style, mixed with the Mexican architectural school, streets and embankments buried in lush equatorial greenery, giant evergreen palms with emerald crowns, incredible exotic flowers, wonderful beaches \u2014 all this awaits you in Rio.

In 1574, the province of Antioquia granted the Spanish settler, Gaspar de Rodas, at his own request, a plot of land to establish and develop a farm. The prosperity of this ranch was the beginning of the economic and demographic development of the future metropolis.</p><p>Later, in 1616, the village of San Lorenzo was already formed here. Its founding is considered the starting point of Medell\u00edn's life. The subsequent formation of the city is associated with the discovery of gold ore deposits in the region.</p><p>The year 1826 was a turning point for Medell\u00edn when Colombia gained its independence from Spain. This event provoked a series of dramatic episodes, among which were uprisings and a thousand-day war. But by the early twentieth century, the city began to grow rapidly, mainly due to the export of cocoa beans.</p><p>A negative trace in the city's life was left by the criminal activity of drug lord Pablo Escobar in the 80s of the last century. It took many more years to get rid of it. But at the end of the twentieth century, the city seemed to have been reborn. There was a rapid development of industry and urban infrastructure, and the city even had a metro.</p><p>The transformation of Medell\u00edn was primarily due to the work of the eminent sculptor Fernando Botero. His interesting urban projects brought success.</p><p>Today, Medell\u00edn is a thriving metropolis that has made a name for itself as a vibrant tourist destination in the Central Andes.</p>"

It seems like the Pacific ocean created a sea beauty named Lima with the help of its waves at the foot of the Andes. As a result, the ocean washes this city with its raging waters, giving it a unique look. This city looks so beautiful, as it combines rocky landscapes with palm trees and ocean breezes. Once you arrive here, you can face an inexplicable sense of deja vu. Nevertheless, the effect of the repetition of Spain develops due to the long colonial dependence of Peru. In turn, as soon as the sound of ocean waters is heard, all allusions instantly disappear. In these moments, tourists usually experience a significant desire to explore the city and increase the level of awareness of its attractions. In Lima, centers of exquisite jewelry can be located next to a small vegetable shop, whereas the richest elite areas alternate with poor neighborhoods and slums. Besides, do not be surprised when you see Japanese sushi that is served in the same restaurant as French croissants. Moreover, it is possible to find the streets dedicated to completely opposite figures: one street can be named in honor of the conquistadors, while the other one can be related to the liberators of Lima. In other words, you will not be able to find a similar city of contrasts in the world! Everyone who wants to feel the spirit of South America with a special aftertaste should visit Lima!"

Legend has it that he and his family emerged from the waters of Lake Titicaca in search of a better place. His golden stick \"went into the ground\" on the site of a settlement of the Savasera Panaca tribe. After Manco Capac destroyed the village, he founded Cusco, the capital of the Inca Empire (translated in Quechua as \"the center of the Earth\" or \"the navel of the Earth\").\n        <p>In the XV century, the ninth Inca ruler, Pachacuti, transformed the Kingdom of Cusco into a prosperous empire. His successor introduced a new tradition. When the Inca died, the title was passed to his son and the property to his other relatives. The new Inca was to build his own house and expand the empire's holdings.</p><p>On November 15, 1533, life in Cusco changed dramatically with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. Francisco Pizarro \"founded\" Cusco anew in 1534. The Europeans rebuilt the city in their own way, preserving its original structure and harmoniously combining traditional Spanish architecture with Inca architecture. Often, the new buildings were erected on ancient stone foundations. This style was called \"mestizo\" and began to manifest itself not only in construction but also in culture.</p><p>Churches were erected in place of Indian temples, a cathedral, university, and archbishopric appeared, and conquistadors' residences were built in place of palaces. During that time, Cuzco continued to develop through agriculture, mining, and trade relations with Spain.</p><p>In 1950, a major earthquake damaged the Dominican monastery and the Church of St. Dominic, exposing the ancient walls of the Indian Temple of the Sun (Coricancha). It was decided not to rebuild the colonial buildings so that locals and tourists could see the historic ruins of this iconic structure.</p><p>In 1983, the city was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. Now Cusco is the main staging post on the way to Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas.</p>"

Over its history, the city has survived more than 40 destructive earthquakes, and in its vicinity, there are 4 active volcanoes. Therefore, the initial appearance of Santiago was practically not preserved, moreover, today it is a city of skyscrapers, which are built here as a symbol of the triumph of man over nature. Santiago is the economic center of Chile, where banks, the headquarters of world corporations, and the office of the UN economic mission are concentrated. It is also a city of parks and squares; it is easy to travel by public transport, metro and buses. The good news for tourists \u2014 Santiago is the safest city in Latin America."

            "en": "\n  Tangier began its history in the V B.C. That was when colonists from Carthage settled in the Phoenician settlement. According to the most popular version, its name came from the name of the Berber deity Tinjis (Tinga). Over the centuries, the city was conquered by the Romans, the Vandals, the Greeks, and the Arabs.\n\nIn 1471, the Portuguese settled here, and in 1580 \u2014 the Spaniards. The Portuguese-Spanish rule lasted until 1661 when the city became the dowry of the Portuguese Infanta Catherine of Braganza, who married the English King Charles II. Tangier passed into British hands.\n        <p>The next milestone in the city's history is the period of 1679, when the Sultan of Morocco, Moulay Ismail Ibn Sharif, tried to seize the territory by storm. Tangier was under siege for a long time. As a result, the British surrendered in 1684, but they had destroyed both the port and the city before that.</p><p>The so-called Tangier Crisis began at the beginning of the XX century (1905-1906). Its essence was that France and Germany argued about who would control the Sultanate of Morocco. At the same time, German Kaiser Wilhelm II came to Tangier and offered the Sultan a defensive alliance. The French were not going to back down and even offered the Germans financial compensation for Morocco, but all offers were rejected. The question of establishing a French protectorate in the territory was postponed for five years. Then, in May 1911, the Second Moroccan Crisis began when the French seized the Moroccan capital, Fez. These events resulted in the division of Morocco into French and Spanish protectorates. And in 1923, Tangier was recognized as an international zone (passed to joint ownership) under the rule of representatives of France, Spain, and Great Britain.

Its inhabitants traded with Carthage until its defeat by the troops of the Roman Empire. In 40, the Romans captured Shella and gave it a new name - Sala Colonia.\n\nAround 250, it was occupied by Berbers, and the next major change was not until 1146, when Abd al-Mu'min, founder of the Almohad dynasty, conquered the coast. He turned the city into a veritable fortress, from which the troops of this militant caliph made raids on Andalusia.\n        <p>The first reference to the city's modern name is found in the chronicles of 1170. In Arabic, it sounded like \"Ribat Al Fath,\" which means \"victorious.\"</p><p>At the end of the XII century, the capital of the expanding Almohad state was moved from Marrakesh to Rabat. The Caliph's grandson, Yacoub al-Mansour, erected the fortress of Kasbah of the Udayas in the city and began constructing the mosque to become the largest in the world. After the ruler's death, construction work stopped, but the building still rises to this day, albeit in an unfinished form.</p><p>During the Marinid dynasty, Rabat fell into decline. Only about 100 houses remained, and the capital was moved to Fez. In the XVII century, many Moorish Christian Moriscos, expelled from Spain, settled in the city, after which the Berber pirates settled there for a long time and created their own Republic of Bou Regreg. In 1818 it was defeated by the Austrian navy.</p><p>In 1912, France took Morocco under its protectorate and returned Rabat as the capital, building several military bases on the coast. After World War II, they were occupied by American troops, leaving the country only after the independence of Morocco in 1956.</p><p>Modern Rabat forms the metropolitan agglomeration with the city of Sal\u00e9, which is separated from it by the Bou R\u00e9greg River.</p>"

Becoming a metropolis of the New York City type, Johannesburg rapidly became a major South African business center. A fierce fight against racial discrimination led to the imprisonment of national hero Nelson Mandela and Indian ideologist Mahatma Gandhi in a local prison. There were no winners or losers in this racial duel. Now Jozi can be compared to the symbol of Yin and Yang, where blacks and whites simply switched places and comfortably continue to exist within the city."
