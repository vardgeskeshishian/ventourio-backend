In addition, various displays and educational programs for different ages are held there regularly.,The famous SeaWorld San Antonio Oceanarium is the largest marine theme park in the world.

The entire complex, with its surviving structures, is a huge museum that tells the story of the Texas War of Independence.,The first Spanish mission in Texas, the Misi\u00f3n San Antonio de Valero, is located in Alamo Plaza.

It is a stylized sculpture of a tree, intricately curved in the shape of a gate. The park zone looks pretty unusual. In fact, it is a real Japanese garden but planted with tropical plants. A walk through the cozy alleys of Japanese Tea Gardens is a great opportunity to rest from the city's noise, admire well-groomed flowerbeds among the hedges, and take pictures of this wonderful place.,The largest caves in Texas near San Antonio are fun and interesting for families to visit.

A separate wing is occupied by works from Korea, India, Japan, and China, including vases made of famous Chinese ceramics.
